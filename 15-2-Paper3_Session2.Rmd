.center[.size40[.content-box-blue[**Solve a Problem with an International Institution**]]]

.size35[
Write a report that identifies, analyzes and attempts to address a significant problem using an international institution.

1. What is the problem and why is it important?

2. Find an example of an international institution that has sought to address this problem in the past. What did it do and how effective was it?

3. Based on the tools we've explored (legalization, the rational design conjectures and PA theory) and the cases we've analyzed, what specific elements would you suggest for the design of a new international institution meant to address your chosen problem?

.size35[
1. What is the problem you are targeting?

2. What important lessons did you learn from the historical case?

3. Describe the characteristics of the new institution
    - Legalization: Level of obligation, precision and delegation?
    
    - Rational design: Which conjectures are most relevant/useful?
    
    - PA theory: What delegation benefits (and relevant control mechanisms) do you suggest?

At this point I want you getting feedback in pairs

- So, pair up and give feedback on the other person's work for today

<br>

Let's make sure to do this a few times in different pairs, so let's do 15 minutes at a time (x3)

- Go!

<br>

Rest of time today is a writing workshop
