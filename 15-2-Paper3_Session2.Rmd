.size40[.content-box-blue[**Final Paper: Reform Proposal**]]

.size40[
Select one of the international institutions we studied this semester and propose a **specific** and **feasible** reform that would improve its functioning. 

Your proposal must be rooted in the actual design of the institution and discuss how it could be pursued without losing important members or inspiring great opposition. 

Do not assume the reader of your report is familiar with the institution you are reforming so make sure to introduce and summarize it in your paper.
]

???

IF you choose the UN and your paper overlaps with the work we did on reforms in class the bar for you will be much higher than with the other institutions.
