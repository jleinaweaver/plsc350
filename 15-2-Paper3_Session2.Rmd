.center[.size40[.content-box-blue[**Solve a Problem with an International Institution**]]]

.size35[
Write a report that identifies, analyzes and attempts to address a significant problem using an international institution.

1. What is the problem and why is it important?

2. Find an example of an international institution that has sought to address this problem in the past. What did it do and how effective was it?

3. Based on the tools we've explored (legalization, the rational design conjectures and PA theory) and the cases we've analyzed, what specific elements would you suggest for the design of a new international institution meant to address your chosen problem?
]

???

Aim is three sections, each making a complete argument.

<br>

### Questions on the assignment?

<br>

For today I asked you to collect your ideas for each part of the assignment.

- I'd like us to use our time today to shape each component and get feedback on your arguments

<br>

Since we explored parts 1 and 2 on Monday, let's warm up by hitting those elements again quickly.

.size65[What is the problem and why is it important?]

???

Section 1 of the paper focuses on you making an argument that the problem you have selected is an important one.

- This ensures both that it is worthy of our time AND

- That your design choices in Section 3 are informed by the actual specifics of the problem itself.

<br>

In a moment we'll go around the room so you can give us your outline for Section 1.

- In other words, what I want to hear are the premises you have selected to support this conclusion

<br>

**SLIDE**: Put even simpler...

???

Section 2 of the paper asks you to analyze a specific example from history of the international community trying to address your chosen problem.

- Both a valuable opportunity for me to see what you've learned about evaluating institutional effectiveness, AND

- Another chance for you to root your Section 3 design in material that speaks to the real-world challenges of the problem

Here I'm using "lessons" as a synonym for premises!

Describe the characteristics of the new institution
- Legalization: Level of obligation, precision and delegation?
    
- Rational design: Which conjectures are most relevant/useful?
    
- PA theory: What delegation benefits (and relevant control mechanisms) do you suggest?
]

???

This one is tougher to do as a group so let's split into pairs.

<br>

Assuming each of these tools represents a premise in your Section 3 argument, get feedback from your partner on how you propose we design our new institution.

<br>

### Questions on what I'm asking you to do?

- Go!

Rest of time today is a writing workshop
