Setting up our aim for this week: How effective is the UN at establishing global standards of behavior? 
- A continuation of our analyses from last Thursday. 

- Specifically, explore CEDAW as a case study of UN delegation in action. 

- Is this evidence that the UN can achieve substantial things for the world?

Review the Zwingel (2016): Is the creation of the CEDAW evidence of the effectiveness of the UN? Why or why not?

- Small groups go through the reading and find us evidence pro vs con, see sections of reading below
