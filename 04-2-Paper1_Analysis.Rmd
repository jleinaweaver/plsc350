Analyses on the board and let's present!

1. Classify using legalization

2. Which KLS conjectures in action?


KLS Problems
- Enforcement,
- uncertainty about preferences,
- distribution,
- uncertainty about behavior,
- uncertainty about the state of the world,
- number

KLS Design Mechanisms
- Restrictive membership
- Scope
- Centralization
- Control
- Flexibility
