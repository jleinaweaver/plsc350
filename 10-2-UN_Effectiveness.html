&lt;br&gt;

*Split class in thirds, assign to each article*

Before I ask each group to diagram the argument in their paper, let's all agree on the end point of each, e.g. the conclusions.

### Groups, what is the key conclusion in your paper?

.size40[
1. "Adjustment proof[ed]" UN sanctions can reduce a rebel group's income (may require shaming or secondary sanctions)

2. Rebel groups need income to "adapt to military losses" (e.g. territorial losses and military setbacks)

3. Rebel groups that cannot adapt lose the "capacity to fight" over time (snowball effect)

Therefore, well designed UN sanctions can weaken rebel groups and reduce ongoing conflicts.
]

???
Arg section is 762-763
- Mechanism linking UN sanctions to reductions in fighting is indirect (meaning it depends on a few steps in the causal chain)

Premise 1
- "Adjustment proof" sanctions: "Some rebel groups are adaptive: when certain revenue streams dry up, they are able to adjust and find income elsewhere. ... Adjustment-proof sanctions occur when the rebel group’s external partners, such as direct state sponsors or trade partners, have complied with sanctions demands and sanctionable items are indeed out of the reach of rebels, curtailing their resource-adaptability."
- The UN must be willing to use "shaming and secondary sanctions" when sponsors or trade partners of rebel groups flout the sanctions.

Premise 2
- Loss of territory cuts off "territorially based income opportunities"
- "When income starts to drop, rebel leaders find it difficult to purchase arms and equipment, pay soldiers, and ensure civilian support."

Premise 3
- "With declining equipment and defecting soldiers, rebels will discover that the military balance starts to tilt towards the government and holding territory becomes a more difficult endeavor. What occurs is a vicious cycle for rebels..."
- Snowball effect: "Unable to adjust, the loss of territory leads to less income, which in turn, leads to more territorial losses and more loss of income."

Hypothesis 1: UN sanctions increase rebel territorial losses.
Hypothesis 2: Rebel territorial losses decrease conflict intensity.

???

*Walk through the data collected and how it measured*

First they present a macro (e.g. overall) test
- 1945-2015
- Sanction dummy does not include state-wide arms embargoes
- For the first three income sources, we rely on the Non-State Actor Dataset (Cunningham, Gleditsch &amp; Salehyan, 2009)
- For lootable resources, we relied on Päivi Lujala’s (2010) data on rebel access to natural resources. The indicator for natural resources has a value of 1 if gems (e.g. diamonds), drugs, oil, hydrocarbon, and/or natural gas are present.

&lt;br&gt;

Micro test
- Focuses on two rebel groups: the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) and al-Shabaab in Somalia.
- Both similar in many aspects (long, high-intensity conflicts with both holding large territory, both sanctioned) BUT different in key one (UNITA is a 1 on resources, al-Shabaab is a 4)

- "For the UNITA case, the major sanction episodes include three events: (1) travel bans on UNITA leadership (Travel ban) on 30 October 1997, (2) an asset freeze and the UN diamond embargo (Asset freeze and diamond ban) on 2 July 1998, and (3) when the chair of the UN sanctions committee on Angola, Robert Fowler, pressured major diamond purchaser, De Beers, into a public commitment to not purchase diamonds sourced in Angola (De Beers) on 6 October 1999" (766).

- "Among the three episodes, the key one is the De Beers commitment. UN sanctions on UNITA were not particularly adjustment-proof. Sanction-busting by several African nations was rampant in the early years of the UNITA sanction regime" (767).
  - "The loss of the world’s chief purchaser of diamonds, which controlled 80% of the global trade, should have had a crippling effect on UNITA’s ability to finance its war, as the group would use these diamond revenues to fund many facets of its day-to-day operations including ‘foreign representation, travel, commodity-procurement and arms purchases’" (Dietrich, 2000: 283).

al-Shabaab is a 4

- "Somali sanctions were relatively adjustment-proof at the outset: al-Shabaab’s main state sponsor, Eritrea, was sanctioned in December 2009 before al-Shabaab was even listed on the asset freeze list in April 2010" (770).

- "This shows that the charcoal ban was the significant sanctioning event that contributed to the group’s territorial losses."

- "We reason that this null finding is the result of al-Shabaab being a highly adaptive and financially diverse organization relying on several revenue streams: taxation, extortion, trade of looted resources, direct state assistance, and a diaspora population (United Nations Security Council, 2011, 2012, 2013; Gettleman &amp; Kulish, 2013; Vilkko, 2011)."

- "In the wake of the UN charcoal ban, al-Shabaab survived by shifting resources to potential income opportunities out of the UN’s reach: taxing smuggled commodities and extortion of the civilian population. UN monitors particularly noted the increase in al-Shabaab’s taxing on the illicit sugar trade and agricultural production as its charcoal revenue declined, as well as the group’s increased taxation or zakat (United Nations Security Council, 2016)."

Mechanism 1: Secure the Borders
- Insurgents may seek plunder, haven or support from neighboring states
- If neighbor opposes the group, insurgents attack (contagion)
- Neighbor supports group, original state attacks (contagion)
- Peacekeepers that can secure the border can prevent contagion (plunder, haven or support).

Mechanism 2: Deal with Refugees
- Armed conflict creates refugees
- Refugee flows into neighboring countries is destabilizing (political and economic problems)
- Peacekeepers can make it safe for people to return to their homes and/or enable resettlement of internally displaced peoples

Therefore, UN peacekeeping can prevent conflicts from spreading across international borders.
]

???

- Note that this argument section is a bit confusingly laid out. Each mechanism is introduced and then given extensive empirical examples.
- Also, mechanisms 3 and 4 seem like restatements of the first two
- Clarify intrastate (within the state) vs interstate (between states) conflict
- Armed conflicts spread geographically through sponsorship of insurgencies and refugee flows
- Authors refer to separate mechanisms that explain peacekeeping vs contagion

Mechanism 1: Peacekeepers can prevent conflict contagion by securing, or enabling the government to secure, the border (against insurgents leaving or external support for them coming in)
- "When insurgent forces engaged in intrastate conflict in one state seek haven or plunder in surrounding states, those surrounding states become more prone to both intrastate and interstate conflict (Salehyan 2007, 2008a, 2009)" (1052).
- Insurgents may seek plunder, haven or support from neighboring states
- If plunder, insurgents attack neighbor (conflict spreads)
- If neighbor opposes haven or support, insurgents attack neighbor (conflict spreads)
- If neighbor provides haven or support, other state may attack (conflict spreads)
- Therefore, peacekeepers that can secure a border (insurgents in and aid kept out) can prevent contagion.
- Border Security Hypothesis: States with neighboring rivals or neighboring weak states will be less likely to experience new armed conflicts when peacekeepers deploy to such neighbors.
- "A primary means by which peacekeepers can prevent such contagion is through securing borders, either directly in the provision of security and monitoring forces or indirectly in strengthening the force projection capacities of the central and regional governments" (1053).
- "Securing borders can decrease the ability of transnational insurgencies to move to other areas"
- "It can also prevent contagion...by restricting the flow of arms and other rebel support in and out of conflict areas" (1053).

Mechanism 2: Peacekeepers can prevent conflict contagion by reducing refugee flows and facilitating repatriation and resettlement.
- Refugee Hypothesis: States that have received many refugees from neighboring states will be less likely to experience new armed conflicts when peacekeepers deploy to such neighbors.
- Armed conflict creates refugees
- "These displaced persons often flee across state borders where, as refugees, they create political and economic problems for the surrounding host states" (...upset political dynamics, exacerbate competition for resources, and otherwise spread arms, combatants, and ideologies that make conflict more likely)
- Can make it safe for people to return to their homes OR enable IOs and NGOs to help resettle internally displace peoples


Mechanism 3: General Containment Hypothesis: States with neighbors that have recently experienced armed conflict will be less likely to experience new armed conflict when peacekeepers deploy to such neighbors.

Mechanism 4: Intrastate Containment Hypothesis: States with neighbors that have recently experienced intrastate armed conflict will be less likely to experience new intrastate or interstate conflict when peacekeepers deploy to such neighbors. States with neighbors that have recently experienced interstate armed conflict will experience less of a decline in their propensity for new armed conflict when peacekeepers deploy to such neighbors.

- Post-civil war countries deal with uncertainty, armed hyper-local factions, local grievances and power vacuums that can lead to new conflict
- Peacekeepers, even in small numbers, can provide monitoring and keep information flowing between the parties
- Peacekeepers, in large numbers, can compensate for lack of control by leaders over local factions
- Peacekeepers, even in small numbers, can mediate in local conflicts preventing escalation (gather information, meet with disputants, requesting third party assistance)
- Peacekeepers can provide enforcement in areas with power vacuums (insufficient rebel or government control)

Therefore, UN peacekeeping can reduce the onset and duration of conflict within a country
]

???

Four distinct mechanisms

1. Monitoring and Credible Commitment
- Rebels and government compete for territorial control and support from the people (even post-conflict)
- This competition may change the balance of resources and create uncertainty about commitments to the peace deal
- Uncertainty increases the risk of conflict 
- Peacekeepers, even in small numbers, can provide monitoring and keep information flowing between the parties 
    - Shows both sides commitment to the terms of the deal
- H1: The onset of armed conflict is less likely in areas where peacekeepers are deployed.

2. Patrolling and Deterrence
- During conflict "elites tend to encourage, mobilize and arm grassroots groups with strong local identity and power-base to fight alongside 'regular' troops" (166) because minor disagreements subsumed by central fight.
- Post-conflict, central fight no longer unifies the groups and rebel factions can splinter leading to conflict or leadership changes with new leaders no longer committed to the deal
- Peacekeepers, in large numbers, can compensate for lack of control by leaders over local factions
- H2: The larger the local deployment of UN forces, the lower the probability of conflict onset is.

3. Mediation and Reassurance
- Post-conflict areas often a hotbed of local grievances that could trigger conflict 
- Conflict also tends to weaken "the capacity and legitimacy of local institutions to deal with disputes" (167)
- Peacekeepers, even in small numbers, can mediate in local conflicts preventing escalation (gather information, meet with disputants, requesting third party assistance)
- H3: Armed conflict is less likely to continue in areas where peacekeepers are deployed.

4. Enforcement
- Post-conflict neither side likely has full control over the entire country (power vacuums for external and transnational actors)
- "Civil war undermines central control, reveals the weakness of the government, increases the availability of arms, and encourages meddling from neighboring countries" (168).
- "Peace agreements may also limit the control of rebel groups - either because of demobilization or by incorporating them into the central authority of a country - without necessarily increasing the control of the central government" (168).
- "Conflict destroys opportunities for peaceful economic activities and rewards violent behavior, often encouraging independent local militias and rebel groups to target displaced persons" (169).
- "Peacekeepers can either directly halt incursions or stop the use of violence by marauding gangs" (168).
- H4: The larger the presence of UN forces in conflict areas, the lower the probability is that conflict continues.

- Analysis is somewhat complicated looking, but we can cut through a lot of it.
- Generally speaking, main analyses in Tables 2 and 3 show:
    - PKO presence does not prevent onset of conflict, BUT
    - DOES reduce duration of conflict
- HOWEVER, PKO size does seem to matter for both (as shown above)
    - Fig 3. Doesn't take many to lower onset but magnitude of effect is tiny
    - Fig 4. Substantial reduction in duration
