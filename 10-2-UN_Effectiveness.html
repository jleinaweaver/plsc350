]

???

(p762-763) Bottom line here: Well designed UN sanctions can weaken rebel groups and reduce ongoing conflicts.

- HOWEVER, the mechanism linking UN sanctions to reductions in fighting is indirect (meaning it depends on a few steps in the causal chain)

&lt;br&gt;

### Group, what do you think? Am I missing anything you'd like to add?

&lt;br&gt;

### Is this a logical model? Why or why not?

&lt;br&gt;

### What kinds of specific predictions about the world does this model make?

&lt;br&gt;

#### Notes

1. "Adjustment proof[ed]" UN sanctions can reduce a rebel group's income (may require shaming or secondary sanctions)
2. Rebel groups need income to "adapt to military losses" (e.g. territorial losses and military setbacks)
3. Rebel groups that cannot adapt lose the "capacity to fight" over time (snowball effect)
- Therefore, well designed UN sanctions can weaken rebel groups and reduce ongoing conflicts.

&lt;br&gt;

Premise 1
- "Adjustment proof" sanctions: "Some rebel groups are adaptive: when certain revenue streams dry up, they are able to adjust and find income elsewhere. ... Adjustment-proof sanctions occur when the rebel group’s external partners, such as direct state sponsors or trade partners, have complied with sanctions demands and sanctionable items are indeed out of the reach of rebels, curtailing their resource-adaptability."
- The UN must be willing to use "shaming and secondary sanctions" when sponsors or trade partners of rebel groups flout the sanctions.

Premise 2
- Loss of territory cuts off "territorially based income opportunities"
- "When income starts to drop, rebel leaders find it difficult to purchase arms and equipment, pay soldiers, and ensure civilian support."

Premise 3
- "With declining equipment and defecting soldiers, rebels will discover that the military balance starts to tilt towards the government and holding territory becomes a more difficult endeavor. What occurs is a vicious cycle for rebels..."
- Snowball effect: "Unable to adjust, the loss of territory leads to less income, which in turn, leads to more territorial losses and more loss of income."

Hypothesis 1: UN sanctions increase rebel territorial losses.
Hypothesis 2: Rebel territorial losses decrease conflict intensity.

**Outcome Variable: Conflict Intensity**
- *Battle deaths* from UCDP Battle-Related Deaths Dataset (Melander, Pettersson &amp; Themnér, 2016)

**Predictor Variables**
- UN Sanction dummy (specific group targeted by sanction = 1)
- Resource Adaptability (0-4, # income opportunities)
    - 1) external state sponsors, 2) non-state sponsors, 3) territorial control, and 4) lucrative natural resources
]

???

Radtke and Jo are focused on rebel activity in civil wars from 1945-2015
- 70 years of data

&lt;br&gt;

Outcome is measured by battle deaths
- HOWEVER, not precisely focused on deaths caused by the rebels (I think)

&lt;br&gt;

Their hypotheses represent an interaction of these two predictor variables

- First predictor is a dummy variable for whether the group was targeted by UN sanctions
    - Does not include state-wide arms embargoes, only if that specific group was targeted (e.g. asset freezes and travel bans)
    
- Second predictor is a 4 level measure of how well resourced a rebel group is
    - e.g. how many of these four things does that group have access to for income
    
&lt;br&gt;

### Is this a good set-up for testing the model? Why or why not?

### - In other words, what big part of the model does this approach not allow us to test?

- (We aren't actually testing if the sanctions have been adjusted or not, just to see if poorly resourced groups are harmed more by any UN sanction)

&lt;br&gt;

#### Notes
- For the first three income sources, we rely on the Non-State Actor Dataset (Cunningham, Gleditsch &amp; Salehyan, 2009)
- For lootable resources, we relied on Päivi Lujala’s (2010) data on rebel access to natural resources. The indicator for natural resources has a value of 1 if gems (e.g. diamonds), drugs, oil, hydrocarbon, and/or natural gas are present.

First the authors test the model at the macro level (e.g. without the more precise mechanisms in action)

- Basically, they examine if rebel groups resources change the effectiveness of UN sanctions.

&lt;br&gt;

Figure 2 summarizes the effect of UN sanctions on battle-deaths for the three categories of rebel group adaptability.

- Key here is UN sanctions only clearly work for the least adaptable rebel groups

- Medium and high resourced groups have CIs that cross zero so effect direction can't be clearly identified

&lt;br&gt;

So, big picture data indicates rebel resources matter for sanction effectiveness

- BUT this test treats all sanctions as equivalent and the model argues they are not.

In order to examine how the type of UN sanctions matters, the authors next focus on micro tests (e.g. across time analysis of one group in one civil war)

&lt;br&gt;

They start by examining the experience of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA)

- Figure 3 shows territorial losses by the group as a line plot with dashed vertical lines representing sanction events (and confusingly, other events)

&lt;br&gt;

Early UN sanctions regimes were wildly ineffective

- The first UN sanction was a travel ban on UNITA leadership (30 October 1997)
    - You can see almost no territorial losses after this

- The second UN sanction was a freeze on UNITA assets and a diamond embargo (2 July 1998)
    - Slightly more effect but still tiny
    
- These were wildly ineffective: "Sanction-busting by several African nations was rampant in the early years of the UNITA sanction regime" (767).

- Third dashed line is actually the resumption of the civil war and that led to a lot of territory changing hands

&lt;br&gt;

Big change: The chair of the UN sanctions committee on Angola, Robert Fowler, pressured major diamond purchaser, De Beers, into a public commitment to not purchase diamonds sourced in Angola (De Beers) on 6 October 1999" (766).

- "The loss of the world’s chief purchaser of diamonds, which controlled 80% of the global trade, should have had a crippling effect on UNITA’s ability to finance its war, as the group would use these diamond revenues to fund many facets of its day-to-day operations including ‘foreign representation, travel, commodity-procurement and arms purchases’" (Dietrich, 2000: 283).

- Some big territorial losses followed that new set of secondary sanctions pressure

???

Remember, the model proposes that income losses lead to territorial losses and territorial losses lead to more income losses eventually reducing the conflict

&lt;br&gt;

Figure 4 is a line plot of the number of battles fought by UNITA over this period

- Here we see a decrease in battles after the first round of sanctions

- The opposite effect after the second round (more battles)

- And the De Beers commitment dramatically reducing the number of battles being fought

&lt;br&gt;

### Pretty neat, huh?

- Key to this effect is that UNITA is only a '1' on the resources scale produced by these researchers.

- They were heavily dependent on diamond sales to fund their insurgency

&lt;br&gt;

#### Notes
Micro test
- Focuses on two rebel groups: the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) and al-Shabaab in Somalia.
- Both similar in many aspects (long, high-intensity conflicts with both holding large territory, both sanctioned) BUT different in key one (UNITA is a 1 on resources, al-Shabaab is a 4)

- "For the UNITA case, the major sanction episodes include three events: (1) travel bans on UNITA leadership (Travel ban) on 30 October 1997, (2) an asset freeze and the UN diamond embargo (Asset freeze and diamond ban) on 2 July 1998, and (3) when the chair of the UN sanctions committee on Angola, Robert Fowler, pressured major diamond purchaser, De Beers, into a public commitment to not purchase diamonds sourced in Angola (De Beers) on 6 October 1999" (766).

- "Among the three episodes, the key one is the De Beers commitment. UN sanctions on UNITA were not particularly adjustment-proof. Sanction-busting by several African nations was rampant in the early years of the UNITA sanction regime" (767).
  - "The loss of the world’s chief purchaser of diamonds, which controlled 80% of the global trade, should have had a crippling effect on UNITA’s ability to finance its war, as the group would use these diamond revenues to fund many facets of its day-to-day operations including ‘foreign representation, travel, commodity-procurement and arms purchases’" (Dietrich, 2000: 283).

Their second case was to focus on al-Shabaab's insurgency in Somalia.

- Unlike UNITA, al-Shabaab is a '4' on the resource scale.

&lt;br&gt;

Figure 5 focuses on territorial losses

- Important note: The dates on the x-axis are wrong and should match those on the right

- The UN sanctioned the leaders of Eritrea who were supporting the al-Shabaab movement on 23 December 2009
    - No effect

- Then they implemented an asset freeze and travel ban on 12 Apr 2010
    - No effect

- Over and over again the sanctions regimes implemented had little to no effect on territorial losses

&lt;br&gt;

Finally on 22 Feb 2012 the UN implemented a prohibition on shipping charcoal out of Somalia.

- "Al-Shabaab relied on the trade of charcoal from southern Somalian ports, an approximately $360 million industry (United Nations Security Council, 2013: 38)."

- Here we start to see territorial losses begin to accumulate.

&lt;br&gt;

HOWEVER, even this was short-lived and ultimately, as we see in Figure 6, didn't lead to reductions in conflict

- "We reason that this null finding is the result of al-Shabaab being a highly adaptive and financially diverse organization relying on several revenue streams: taxation, extortion, trade of looted resources, direct state assistance, and a diaspora population (United Nations Security Council, 2011, 2012, 2013; Gettleman &amp; Kulish, 2013; Vilkko, 2011)."

- "In the wake of the UN charcoal ban, al-Shabaab survived by shifting resources to potential income opportunities out of the UN’s reach: taxing smuggled commodities and extortion of the civilian population. UN monitors particularly noted the increase in al-Shabaab’s taxing on the illicit sugar trade and agricultural production as its charcoal revenue declined, as well as the group’s increased taxation or zakat (United Nations Security Council, 2016)."

&lt;br&gt;

So, the UN has an important role to play in weakening insurgencies with sanctions, HOWEVER, they are limited in what they can accomplish! Rebel group resources matter.

### Make sense?

]

???

Bottom line here: UN peacekeeping can prevent conflicts from spreading across international borders.

- Note that I'm ignoring the final two hypotheses which seem to just restate the others in a more general form.

&lt;br&gt;

### Group, what do you think? Am I missing anything you'd like to add?

&lt;br&gt;

### Is this a logical model? Why or why not?

&lt;br&gt;

### What kinds of specific predictions about the world does this model make?

&lt;br&gt;

#### Notes
Mechanism 1: Secure the Borders
- Insurgents may seek plunder, haven or support from neighboring states
- If neighbor opposes the group, insurgents attack (contagion)
- Neighbor supports group, original state attacks (contagion)
- Peacekeepers that can secure the border can prevent contagion (plunder, haven or support).

Mechanism 2: Deal with Refugees
- Armed conflict creates refugees
- Refugee flows into neighboring countries is destabilizing (political and economic problems)
- Peacekeepers can make it safe for people to return to their homes and/or enable resettlement of internally displaced peoples

Therefore, UN peacekeeping can prevent conflicts from spreading across international borders.

- Note that this argument section is a bit confusingly laid out. Each mechanism is introduced and then given extensive empirical examples.
- Also, mechanisms 3 and 4 seem like restatements of the first two
- Clarify intrastate (within the state) vs interstate (between states) conflict
- Armed conflicts spread geographically through sponsorship of insurgencies and refugee flows
- Authors refer to separate mechanisms that explain peacekeeping vs contagion

Mechanism 1: Peacekeepers can prevent conflict contagion by securing, or enabling the government to secure, the border (against insurgents leaving or external support for them coming in)
- "When insurgent forces engaged in intrastate conflict in one state seek haven or plunder in surrounding states, those surrounding states become more prone to both intrastate and interstate conflict (Salehyan 2007, 2008a, 2009)" (1052).
- Insurgents may seek plunder, haven or support from neighboring states
- If plunder, insurgents attack neighbor (conflict spreads)
- If neighbor opposes haven or support, insurgents attack neighbor (conflict spreads)
- If neighbor provides haven or support, other state may attack (conflict spreads)
- Therefore, peacekeepers that can secure a border (insurgents in and aid kept out) can prevent contagion.
- Border Security Hypothesis: States with neighboring rivals or neighboring weak states will be less likely to experience new armed conflicts when peacekeepers deploy to such neighbors.
- "A primary means by which peacekeepers can prevent such contagion is through securing borders, either directly in the provision of security and monitoring forces or indirectly in strengthening the force projection capacities of the central and regional governments" (1053).
- "Securing borders can decrease the ability of transnational insurgencies to move to other areas"
- "It can also prevent contagion...by restricting the flow of arms and other rebel support in and out of conflict areas" (1053).

Mechanism 2: Peacekeepers can prevent conflict contagion by reducing refugee flows and facilitating repatriation and resettlement.
- Refugee Hypothesis: States that have received many refugees from neighboring states will be less likely to experience new armed conflicts when peacekeepers deploy to such neighbors.
- Armed conflict creates refugees
- "These displaced persons often flee across state borders where, as refugees, they create political and economic problems for the surrounding host states" (...upset political dynamics, exacerbate competition for resources, and otherwise spread arms, combatants, and ideologies that make conflict more likely)
- Can make it safe for people to return to their homes OR enable IOs and NGOs to help resettle internally displace peoples


Mechanism 3: General Containment Hypothesis: States with neighbors that have recently experienced armed conflict will be less likely to experience new armed conflict when peacekeepers deploy to such neighbors.

Mechanism 4: Intrastate Containment Hypothesis: States with neighbors that have recently experienced intrastate armed conflict will be less likely to experience new intrastate or interstate conflict when peacekeepers deploy to such neighbors. States with neighbors that have recently experienced interstate armed conflict will experience less of a decline in their propensity for new armed conflict when peacekeepers deploy to such neighbors.

Beardsley is focused on the spread of conflict across state borders from 1946-2005
- 59 years of data

&lt;br&gt;

Outcome is measured by: Did a conflict start in that month?
- An armed conflict episode occurs when there is a dispute that involves at least one government actor and results in 25 battle-related fatalities in a year.

&lt;br&gt;

Peacekeeping forces
- "...deployment of military personnel to a foreign state by the UN, a regional security organization or a coalition of states."
- Omits cases where a single state sends in "peacekeepers" e.g. Russian troops doing peacekeeping in breakaway Russian areas in neighboring states
- ...the purpose of the force must be for "observing, patrolling, monitoring, disarming, intimidating, or combating."

&lt;br&gt;

The next three predictors are meant to combine to represent the "potential transnational insurgencies and refugee flows" from neighboring states

- Unfortunately, very little detail provided on these in the article

- Neighboring rival = More likely to interfere in your conflict

- Poor neighbor = More likely refugees out or refugees in swamping public services

- Actual refugees = Current refugee pressures

&lt;br&gt;

### What do we think of operationalizing and instrumenting the "potential transnational insurgencies and refugee flows" with these three measures? Pros and cons?

&lt;br&gt;

Good lesson for us about the challenges of finding data for the mechanisms we want to test

The empirics in this paper are REALLY hard to disentangle.

- However, Figure 2 presents relative risks (e.g. the likelihood of conflict breaking out in a neighboring country)

- What we see here is that peacekeeping operations dramatically reduce the likelihood of conflict spreading across border

- Unfortunately, this doesn't represent a test of the refugee problem or the support for insurgents problem focused on in the model

&lt;br&gt;

As best I can tell from the full regression results in Table 1

- PKOs **eliminate** the danger of rival neighbors spreading conflict

- BUT only **reduce** the risks of having poor neighbors or serious refugee problems lead to conflict.

&lt;br&gt;

So, the UN has an important role to play in stopping the spread or contagion of conflicts across international borders!

Bottom line here: UN peacekeeping can reduce the onset and duration of conflict within a country

&lt;br&gt;

### Group, what do you think? Am I missing anything you'd like to add?

&lt;br&gt;

### Is this a logical model? Why or why not?

&lt;br&gt;

### What kinds of specific predictions about the world does this model make?

&lt;br&gt;

#### Notes
- "Our analysis considers the impact of peacekeeping on the onset and duration of local armed conflict, defined as the organized and armed use of violence between governmental and rebel forces at a particular locality" (164)
- Post-civil war countries deal with uncertainty, armed hyper-local factions, local grievances and power vacuums that can lead to new conflict

Four distinct mechanisms

1. Monitoring and Credible Commitment
    - Peacekeepers, even in small numbers, can provide monitoring and keep information flowing between the parties
    - Rebels and government compete for territorial control and support from the people (even post-conflict)
    - This competition may change the balance of resources and create uncertainty about commitments to the peace deal
    - Uncertainty increases the risk of conflict 
    - Peacekeepers, even in small numbers, can provide monitoring and keep information flowing between the parties 
    - Shows both sides commitment to the terms of the deal
    - H1: The onset of armed conflict is less likely in areas where peacekeepers are deployed.

2. Patrolling and Deterrence
    - Peacekeepers, in large numbers, can compensate for lack of control by leaders over local factions
    - During conflict "elites tend to encourage, mobilize and arm grassroots groups with strong local identity and power-base to fight alongside 'regular' troops" (166) because minor disagreements subsumed by central fight.
    - Post-conflict, central fight no longer unifies the groups and rebel factions can splinter leading to conflict or leadership changes with new leaders no longer committed to the deal
    - Peacekeepers, in large numbers, can compensate for lack of control by leaders over local factions
    - H2: The larger the local deployment of UN forces, the lower the probability of conflict onset is.

3. Mediation and Reassurance
    - Peacekeepers, even in small numbers, can mediate in local conflicts preventing escalation (gather information, meet with disputants, requesting third party assistance)
    - Post-conflict areas often a hotbed of local grievances that could trigger conflict
    - Conflict also tends to weaken "the capacity and legitimacy of local institutions to deal with disputes" (167)
    - Peacekeepers, even in small numbers, can mediate in local conflicts preventing escalation (gather information, meet with disputants, requesting third party assistance)
    - H3: Armed conflict is less likely to continue in areas where peacekeepers are deployed.

4. Enforcement
    - Peacekeepers can provide enforcement in areas with power vacuums (insufficient rebel or government control)
    - Post-conflict neither side likely has full control over the entire country (power vacuums for external and transnational actors)
    - "Civil war undermines central control, reveals the weakness of the government, increases the availability of arms, and encourages meddling from neighboring countries" (168).
    - "Peace agreements may also limit the control of rebel groups - either because of demobilization or by incorporating them into the central authority of a country - without necessarily increasing the control of the central government" (168).
    - "Conflict destroys opportunities for peaceful economic activities and rewards violent behavior, often encouraging independent local militias and rebel groups to target displaced persons" (169).
    - "Peacekeepers can either directly halt incursions or stop the use of violence by marauding gangs" (168).
    - H4: The larger the presence of UN forces in conflict areas, the lower the probability is that conflict continues.

Ruggeri, Dorussen &amp; Gizelis (2017) collect data on all major UN missions in sub-Saharan Africa 1989-2006
- Angola, Burundi, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Sudan

&lt;br&gt;

Within each country they collected data on 50 km areas
- This allows them to test their model on the super local level

&lt;br&gt;

Figure 1 illustrates one of the big reasons why testing our models at the local level is so important
- We don't deploy PKOs across the entire country (e.g. 1 person per square mile) because that would be silly

- So, why should we expect the effect of a PKO soldier on commitment or enforcement problems where they aren't?

The Conflict Site Dataset (CSD) is used to identify the location of violent conflict. 
- CSD is an extension to the UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflicts Dataset and provides coordinates for the conflict zones in given countries" (170).

&lt;br&gt;

All of the peacekeeping data is drawn from UN sources.

Now, the analysis is somewhat complicated looking, but we can cut through a lot of it.

&lt;br&gt;

Big takeaway number 1 is kind of depressing

- Logit regression, because not provided as a visualization in the paper

- Across 640-ish observations representing 17 years of UN missions in Africa shows that peacekeepers do not appear to prevent the onset of conflict (row 1)
    - Estimated effect is negative, but the model doesn't fit the data well enough to be confident in it

- This is a BIG problem for the model given that the whole story focuses on stopping the reoccurence of conflict.

&lt;br&gt;

**SLIDE**: However...

That prior test simply asked about any PKO being placed in a country.

- When the regression is allowed to consider the size of the PKO the effect is more in line with the model's predictions.

- The effect is negative and significant

- Interestingly, it actually doesn't take that big a PKO to maximize the effect!

- Very small deployments don't seem to work, but it really doesn't take many to achieve significant results prolonging peace!

&lt;br&gt;

### Make sense?

Even MORE impressive is the effect of PKOs on the duration of any new conflict that begins

- Fig 4. Substantial reduction in duration

- The probability of a new conflict continuing over time is DRAMATICALLY reduced by the size of the PKO force

- Makes some sense as putting 500 troops in a 50 km area is a lot of coverage

&lt;br&gt;

So, the UN has demonstrated an ability to prolong peace in post-conflict countries (at least in Africa in the recent past)
