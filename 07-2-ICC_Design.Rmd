Article 1 of the Rome Statute (1998) reveals a ton of useful information about the ICC.
- Examples?

### What does it mean to say the ICC is a permanent institution?
- Aim is to create something that would become an important feature of world politics.
- Something that wouldn’t need its authority or mandate to be renewed.

In the modern era, but before the ICC, the world was confronted with two atrocities that inspired outrage similar to that following WWII.
- Yugoslavia and Rwanda in the early 1990s: Genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity

- Not really anybody’s responsibility unless the ongoing domestic crimes threatened international peace and order (e.g. UNSC)

- The UNSC acted to create ad hoc tribunals to investigate and punish criminal acts
    - Ex: SC resolution 827 in 1993 created the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugolsavia (ICTY)
    - Ex: SC resolution 955 in 1994 created the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR).

- The creation of these tribunals, and especially ICTY, led to considerable international criticism.

### BRAINSTORM: Why might a state, an NGO or an IO have a problem with this ad hoc approach by the SC?
1. (**Inconsistency**) 
    - Not every atrocity gets its own tribunal. Is this inconsistency going to change the calculations of a “bad” leader? A credible punishment?)
2. (**Selective justice**)
    - If these are international crimes in these states, then shouldn’t similar crimes be punished anywhere they happen? Are we just applying the “justice” of the victors?)
3. (**Distraction**)
    - Transparent cover for failure by the major powers to stop the crimes themselves
4. (**Lack legitimacy**)
    - What right does the SC have to create international courts? None specified in Charter.

Creating a permanent institution for dealing with these kinds of crimes provides extensive benefits to the world
    - Consistency of application, plus
    - Equality of protection, plus
    - Rooted in legitimate international authority
    
All combined hopefully alters the decisionmaking of “bad” leaders.

Name another important characteristic illustrated by Article 1.
(2. “jurisdiction over persons”)


- DISCUSS: What does that mean and why important?


Novel innovation in 20th century international law to directly connect individuals to an international institution.
- Previously an indirect connection; states agree rules between themselves and then implement them domestically to impact individuals.




- DISCUSS: In what ways is this an innovation that will create important benefits for people around the world?


1. You as an individual are deserving of protection even against the state that rules over you.
2. You as an individual are responsible for your actions and the actions of those who report to you.


- DISCUSS: In what ways does this substantially undermine a system that holds state sovereignty as a foundational principle?


Massive threat to state sovereignty.
- Threat to hierarchical orders (citizens must be careful before following your commands)
- Proposes a set of societal rules and individual rights that are hierarchically superior to your domestic laws.


What leader wants to run a system where you don’t make all the rules and your subordinates don’t have to follow your commands?


* Starting place for Wednesday *




Name another important characteristic illustrated by Article 1.
(3. teases subject jurisdiction: only the most serious crimes of international concern) 


- What article lists the subject jurisdiction of the ICC?
(Article 5 has the list, Articles 6-8 elaborate on each)


- What specific crimes can the ICC punish?
(a. the crime of genocide; b. crimes against humanity; c. War crimes; d. the crime of aggression)




Name another important characteristic illustrated by Article 1.
(4. “complementary”) 


- Which article explains this complementarity idea and what does it mean?
(Art 17: National courts have priority over the ICC unless “unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out the investigation or prosecution...”)


- If you are a state, what aspect of this idea would you find most troubling?
(If the ICC gets to decide “genuine” effort, than almost ANYTHING could be their jurisdiction)




Putting all this together, when does the ICC have jurisdiction over a case?
(1. Person alleged to have committed crime in Art 5; 2. Must be citizen of ICC party state or have committed crime in ICC party state; 3. Domestic courts must fail to “genuinely” investigate or prosecute.)

- I had to make some tweaks to hit the interesting parts of the treaty

Group 1) How effectively can states delay / obstruct an investigation they do not want?
    - International cooperation (Part IX, Art. 86-102)
    
Group 2) How does the ICC prosecutor decide to investigate?
    - Investigation and prosecution (Part V, Art. 53-61)

Group 3) How does enforcement work?
    - Enforcement (Part X, Art 103-111)
    
Group 4) Who are the judges? How autonomous are they?
    - Composition and administration of the Court (Part IV Art 34-52)

* Give each of these discussions room to breathe *

GIVEN ALL OF THIS, WHERE WOULD YOU PLACE THE CAT ON THE HARD TO SOFT LAW DIMENSION? WHY?

(Level 3? High obligation and precision, low delegation?)



ARE WE CLEAR ON WHAT THE AIMS OF THE TREATY ARE?
- ARE THEY RELATED TO THE LOFTY LANGUAGE IN THE PREAMBLE OR SOMETHING ELSE?



BASED ON THE OBSTACLES IT FACES AND THE DESIGN YOU REVIEWED, HOW CONFIDENT SHOULD WE BE THAT THE CAT WILL ACHIEVE ITS AIMS?
