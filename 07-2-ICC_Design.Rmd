???

Today we continue our exploration of international institutions designed for mutual restraint by digging into the design of the International Criminal Court (ICC) 

- We'll use the reading to cover the broad strokes of how the court works, 

- we'll use your cases to illustrate it in action, and then 

- we'll dig into the design of the Rome Statute itself.

An International Criminal Court (‘the Court’) is hereby established. It shall be a permanent institution and shall have the power to exercise its jurisdiction over persons for the most serious crimes of international concern, as referred to in this Statute, and shall be complementary to national criminal jurisdictions. The jurisdiction and functioning of the Court shall be governed by the provisions of this Statute.

???

Let's start in big picture terms with Article 1 of the treaty.

- We'll use this as a jumping off point for discussing the Court primarily as it is discussed in the first three sections of the reading

- "The ICC at a glance", "The structure of the ICC" and "Crimes within the jurisdiction of the ICC"

<br>

This article contains a ton of important detail about the need for and the design of the court.

### Why does Article 1 invoke the language of a "permanent institution"?

### - Why was this needed?

```
]

???

In the modern era, but before the ICC, the world was confronted with two atrocities that inspired outrage similar to that following WWII.

- In both Yugoslavia and Rwanda in the early 1990s: Genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity

<br>

The problem was that no one at the international level had the clear authority to do anything about either case

- Both were domestic actions happening within a single state's sovereign borders

<br>

The UN Security Council, which is charged with maintaining international peace and order, eventually created ad hoc tribunals to investigate and punish criminal acts in each case

- SC resolution 827 in 1993 created the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugolsavia (ICTY)

- SC resolution 955 in 1994 created the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR).

<br>

The creation of these tribunals, especially ICTY, led to considerable international criticism.

### BRAINSTORM: Why might a state, an NGO or an IO have a problem with this ad hoc approach by the SC?

1. (**Inconsistency**) 
    - Not every atrocity gets its own tribunal. 
    - If justice is inconsistent then it is less likely to influence the calculations of "bad" leaders
    
2. (**Selective justice**)
    - Aren't these just examples of "justice" by the victors?
    - Powerful states disagree with some actions by weaker states so they are punished as "crimes"

3. (**Distraction**)
    - Transparent cover for failure by the major powers to stop the crimes themselves

4. (**Lack legitimacy**)
    - What right does the SC have to create international courts? None specified in Charter.

]]]

???

The ICC was designed to be a "permanent institution" in order to address these concerns

- The ICC provides a consistency of application, plus

- An equality of protection, plus

- It is rooted in legitimate international authority.

<br>
    
All combined to, hopefully, push leaders to make "better" decisions

.center[.size50[.content-box-white[**PA Theory: Why Delegate?**]]]

.size40[
"Delegation is a conditional grant of authority from a principal to an agent that empowers the latter to act on behalf of the former" (Hawkins et al 2006, 4).

- Always governed by a contract

- Limited in time or scope

- Must be revocable

- Roles are mutually constitutive
]

???

### How do we understand the creation of a "permanent institution" using the definition of "delegation" from PA Theory?

### - Doesn't this conflict with the second and third conditions here?

<br>

**Revocable?**
- Since each "principal", e.g. state party to the treaty, has the option to withdraw from the Rome Statute they maintain the "revocable" condition of the relationship.

**Limited?**
- I think you'll see that a number of limitations on both time and scope remain despite the ICC being "permanent".

]]]

???

A second important characteristic of the ICC illustrated by Article 1 is its specification of "jurisdiction over persons." 

### Given everything we've studied this semester about international law, why is this a big deal?

<br>

Novel innovation in 20th century international law to directly connect individuals to an international institution.

- Previously an indirect connection; states agree rules between themselves and then implement them domestically to impact individuals.

<br>

Pushes international law in some very intriguing directions

1. Establishes the idea that you, as an individual, are deserving of international protection even if that means limiting the soverign authority of your state

2. Establishes the idea that you, as an individual, are responsible for your actions and the actions of those who report to you.

<br>

Many states, especially the US, have viewed this as a massive threat to their  sovereignty.

- Proposes a set of societal rules and individual rights that are hierarchically superior to your domestic laws, and

- Puts in the heads of your citizens that they must think for themselves BEFORE following your orders

- What leader wants to run a system where you don’t make all the rules and your subordinates don’t have to follow your commands?

]]]

???

A third important characteristic of the ICC illustrated by Article 1 is its specification of a somewhat limited subject jurisdiction.

### Per the reading, which crimes fall within the jurisdiction of the ICC?
- (a. the crime of genocide; b. crimes against humanity; c. War crimes; d. the crime of aggression)

- Note that this is covered in the treaty itself in Arts 5-8

<br>

We can think of this as another important attempt by the princples to narrow the scope of the new agent.

The jurisdiction and functioning of the Court shall be governed by the provisions of this Statute.
]]]

???

A fourth important characteristic of the ICC illustrated by Article 1 is its requirement that the court be "complementary to national criminal jurisdictions."

### Per the reading, what does this mean?
- (Article 17: National courts have priority over the ICC unless “unwilling or unable genuinely to carry out the investigation or prosecution...”)

<br>

### If you are a state trying to decide whether to joi the ICC, would you be fully comforted by the "complementarity" principal or not?
- (Could be a bigger infringement than you realized if the ICC gets to decide “genuine” effort)
- (Almost ANYTHING could be their jurisdiction)

<br>

### Ok, putting all this together, when does the ICC have jurisdiction over a case?
1. Person alleged to have committed crime in Art 5
2. Must be citizen of ICC party state or have committed crime in ICC party state
3. Domestic courts must fail to “genuinely” investigate or prosecute.

```

???

One other set-up idea comes from Article 21 of the Rome Statute governing how the ICC judges are supposed to adjudicate their cases.

### How does this compare to the ICJ article 38 we have so frequently discussed this semester?

<br>

### Why the differing focus here on primarily the Rome Statute?

- (Not about state vs state conflicts with a wide range of scopes; this is narrowly about individual offenses as defined primarily by this treaty)

<br>

#### Notes

ICJ Article 38
1. The Court, whose function is to decide in accordance with international law such disputes as are submitted to it, shall apply:
    - international conventions, whether general or particular, establishing rules expressly recognized by the contesting states;
    - international custom, as evidence of a general practice accepted as law;
    - the general principles of law recognized by civilized nations;
    - subject to the provisions of Article 59, judicial decisions and the teachings of the most highly qualified publicists of the various nations, as subsidiary means for the determination of rules of law.
    
2. This provision shall not prejudice the power of the Court to decide a case ex aequo et bono, if the parties agree thereto.
