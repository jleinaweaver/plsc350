This week's plan is to explore the international effort to stop the government use of torture.

- Today we summarize and analyze the treaty 

- Thursday we explore the debate about whether the CAT has been effective or not

&lt;br&gt;

**SLIDE**: We'll organize our work similarly to how we did it last week.

???

I'm not trying to be flippant here.
- International law for mutual restraint means deciding that there are some issues states and their citizens cannot decide for themselves.

&lt;br&gt;

Given everything we just discussed from the AI report I want you to reflect on two things

### 1) Is this problem clear enough and serious enough to merit international law infringing on state sovereignty?

&lt;br&gt;

### 2) Is this a problem international law is likely to be effective in solving? Why or why not?

- Art 21: Do you accept oversight by states?

- Art 22: Do you accept oversight by individuals?

- Both of those open you to oversight and negotiation with other states BUT Art 22 threatens to open you to something very different: It empowers non-state actors to make serious claims on your behavior!

Art 20: Acceptance of and objection to reservations

Art 22: Withdrawal of reservations and of objections to reservations

???

Let's now talk treaty reservations.

- Refresher from the Shaw (2008) chapter a few weeks back

- "“reservation” means a unilateral statement, however phrased or named, made by a State, when signing, ratifying, accepting, approving or acceding to a treaty, whereby it purports to exclude or to modify the legal effect of certain provisions of the treaty in their application to that State;" (Art 2)

- These articles try to make clear how reservations can and cannot be made

- Reservations are different from "statements ... not intended to have the legal effect of a reservation, such as understandings, political statements or interpretive declarations" (915).

- Reservations are also different from statements meant to guide domestic application / interpretation.

- Vienna Art 20 has the rules for whether a reservation is acceptable. Not an easy answer as it depends on the context of the situation and the degree to which the reservation messes with the object and purpose of the treaty. 
    - At the weak end an objection to a reservation may just modify the relationship between the reserving and the objecting state and only as it pertains to the article being reservation-ed. At the strong end reservations can be nullified if deeply problematic or unacceptable to the other states.
    - In general, if you don't object within 12 months of the reservation you've accepted it.

&lt;br&gt;

### Questions on these general rules of reservations?

&lt;br&gt;

- Best case scenario: Allowing reservations encourages wider participation by allowing states to modify their obligations on minor issues.

- Worst case scenario: Completely ruins the agreement and thoroughly complicates state interactions

&lt;br&gt;

**SLIDE**: CAT reservation rules...

&lt;br&gt;

#### Vienna Convention Notes
Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (1969)
ART 2(D)
"'reservation' means a unilateral statement, however phrased or named, made by a State, when signing, ratifying, accepting, approving or acceding to a treaty, whereby it purports to exclude or to modify the legal effect of certain provisions of the treaty in their application to that State;"

ART 19: FORMULATION OF RESERVATIONS
("A State may, when signing, ratifying, accepting, approving or acceding to a treaty, formulate a reservation unless:
(a) the reservation is prohibited by the treaty;
(b) the treaty provides that only specified reservations, which do not include the reservation in question, may be made; or
(c) in cases not falling under sub-paragraphs (a) and (b), the reservation is incompatible with the object and purpose of the treaty."

ART 20: ACCEPTANCE OF AND OBJECTION TO RESERVATIONS
ART 21: LEGAL EFFECTS OF RESERVATIONS AND OF OBJECTIONS TO RESERVATIONS
ART 22: WITHDRAWAL OF RESERVATIONS AND OF OBJECTIONS TO RESERVATIONS

### How substantial a set of loopholes does this make possible in the CAT?

### - Do any of these things hit directly on the elements you identified today as important design elements of the CAT?

&lt;br&gt;

Let's look at some of the specific reservations to the CAT!

- Everybody open the link in the syllabus and scan through the reservations attached below the table of dates.

&lt;br&gt;

First, let's locate examples of what Shaw (2008) would classify as 'simple declarations.'

- *ON BOARD or YOU HIGHLIGHT ON THE SCREEN*

&lt;br&gt;

Now, let's try to find examples that seriously alter the design of the CAT.

### Give me examples of states with reservations that you believe most substantially alter the CAT.

- *ON BOARD or on screen*

- *Really encourage these discussions*

&lt;br&gt;

### Should the state parties have rejected Pakistan's reservation? Why or why not?

&lt;br&gt;

### What about the US reservations to the torture definition in Art 1? Are these going too far? Why or why not?

Let's once again shift back to the Rational Design article by Koremenos, Lipson &amp; Snidal (2001).

### Does the design of the CAT offer support for the key premises in those authors model of international cooperation? Why or why not?

- *Talk to your group, then report back!*

&lt;br&gt;

#### Notes
- Rational design: States and other international actors, acting for self-interested reasons, design institutions purposefully to advance their joint interests.
- Shadow of the future: The value of future gains is strong enough to support a cooperative arrangement.
- Transaction costs: Establishing and participating in international institutions is costly.
- Risk aversion: States are risk-averse and worry about possible adverse effects when creating or modifying international institutions.

Map is using latest data from the V-Dem project

- This variable measures a country-year by the level of torture being practiced

- 0: Not respected by public authorities. Torture is practiced systematically and is incited and approved by the leaders of government.

- 1: Weakly respected by public authorities. Torture is practiced frequently but is often not incited or approved by top leaders of government. At the same time, leaders of government are not actively working to prevent it.

- 2: Somewhat. Torture is practiced occasionally but is typically not approved by top leaders of government.

- 3: Mostly respected by public authorities. Torture is practiced in a few isolated cases but is not incited or approved by top government leaders.

- 4: Fully respected by public authorities. Torture is non-existent.

&lt;br&gt;

### Given everything we've discussed today, is it fair to evaluate the CAT in terms of the level of torture happening within countries after ratification? Why or why not?

&lt;br&gt;

### Focusing on the design of the treaty itself, what are "fair" tests of the effectiveness of the CAT?

### - In other words, based on what the treaty is ACTUALLY DESIGNED TO DO, what evidence would we need to argue the treaty has worked?

Next class we dive into the academic literature that tries to answer this question!

&lt;br&gt;

Your job to get ready for class is simply to identify the argument being tested

- Who are the interests the paper is focusing on?

- What are the institutions that structure their behavior?

- What are the interactions that complicate their behavior?

&lt;br&gt;

In class we'll diagram and discuss those models and then review the analyses together.
