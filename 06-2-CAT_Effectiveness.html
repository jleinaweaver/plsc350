For today you read the arguments to three attempts to evaluate the effectiveness of the NPT.

*Split class in thirds, assign to each article*

Before I ask each group to diagram the argument in their paper, let's all agree on the end point of each, e.g. the conclusions.

- Domestic enforcement capacity matters
    - Most human rights treaties create rules but include no meaningful international enforcement (592).
    - More developed domestic systems empower actors inside and outside of government to enforce treaty rules (593).
    
- Collateral consequences matter
    - Ratification may empower human rights advocacy groups to pressure the government (596).
    - Ratification may empower transnational actors (aid, trade, or other) to pressure the government (596)
]

???

So, Hathaway (2007) expects states to consider these two dynamics BEFORE ratifying a treaty.

### What do we think of the model?

### - Is it logical?

### - Is it convincing?

### - How do we use this model to make predictions in the world?

(Hathaway's argument pushes us to think about the complexity of international law: Treaty design x domestic politics x international politics)

The good: Treaties can influence behavior without international enforcement

The bad: Only works in states with domestic enforcement capabilities.
- If none, e.g. dictatorship, even hard law is likely ineffective. 

So,
- autocracies will ratify for reasons besides their use of torture.
- democracies will ratify ONLY if they don't torture and don't anticipate needing to torture in future.

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;img src="06-2-CAT_Effectiveness_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

???

Before we dig into the figures in the paper, let's set up what we'll be looking at.

This is a marginal effects plot that presents us with the effect of democracy and torture on the probability a state ratifies the CAT.
- x-axis: Level of democracy

- y-axis: Effect of increasing torture level on the likelihood of ratifying CAT

- Cox Proportional Hazard Regressions produce hazard ratios
    - This means our interest is in effects above or below '1'
    - '1' means essentially no effect
    
### So, based on these fake results, what is the effect of using torture on CAT ratifications?
- (Per this line, in all countries (e.g. any level of democracy) their level of torture use has no effect on ratification probabilities)

- If the data analysis produced this line we would say that the actual use of torture has NO IMPACT on whether states join the CAT.

&lt;br&gt;

### Given that CAT aims to criminalize torture, what kind of line should we expect to see?
- (**SLIDE**)

???

This line would indicate that for all countries, regardless of level of democracy, using torture makes them less likely to ratify the CAT (-50%).

- If the CAT makes torture harder then we'd hope states that do it alot would hesitate to join!

### Make sense?

Ok, here's the real results.

### Ignore the dashed lines (confidence intervals) for a moment and tell me, what did Hathaway (2007) find?

Figure 1
- Dictatorships who use torture are MORE likely to ratify the CAT
- Democracies that use torture are LESS likely to ratify
- Democracy of 1, hazard ratio of 1.4 (+40%)
- Democracy of 10, hazard ratio of .7 (-30%)

Figure 2
- Same general trend but weaker effect

- If the system is open to opposition parties, joining CAT is a "relatively cheap concession" (raises the costs of torture in small ways).

Figures 2 and 3 are survival curves.
- Event history analysis or hazard analysis was developed by medical researchers who were studying how treatments could be used to prolong lives.

Say, to compare the length of survival for patients who received a medicine vs those who did not.
- The likelihood of survival could be tracked across time.

In this case, "survival" is a status of not ratifying.
- The line shows states ratifying over time.

- "As one moves across the x-axis, the lines descend, as more and more countries sign/ratify over time. Note that in both figures the dashed line, representing dictatorships with multiple parties, descends more rapidly than the solid line, which represents dictatorships without parties. Tests indicate that this difference is statistically significant for both signing and ratifying. Dictatorships with multiple political parties are more likely to enter into the CAT" (87).

- A score of .5 would mean states ratifying at half the baseline rate.

- A score of 2 would mean states ratifying at twice the baseline rate.

MAKE SENSE?

&lt;br&gt;

### Bottom line takeaways on the Vreeland (2008) piece?

So, now we have a much better sense of "why" dictatorships who torture also join the CAT.

]

???

This is what Jim Vreeland calls the "badass" theory of torture.

Make sure to explain the costs vs benefits of torture in this model
- Torture represents an expensive and complicated set of institutions
- More it is used, more anger/opposition generated
- Systems with extensive torture unlikely to have thriving communities and economies (see DPRK)
- Being the leader of a rich country is fun, being the leader of an impoverished and angry country is less so

&lt;br&gt;

Rather than the data analysis I'd like to step you through the formal model in this paper.

Formal modeling is a way of turning theoretical arguments into mathematical proofs.
- In essence, can we turn the interests, institutions and interactions relevant to a social outcome into clear formulas?

We won't step through the whole model because it gets super complicated and isn't important for our purposes today.

However, we should look at the basics of the formal model together.

Go to page 289, skim the first paragraph under "Model" and tell me: Who are the interests in this game?

REMIND ME, IN MOST OF THE POLI SCI LITERATURE WHAT DO WE MEAN BY "INTERESTS"?
(The actors of interest and what they want.)



SO, WHO ARE THE ACTORS IN THIS MODEL OF TORTURE AND WHAT DO THEY WANT?

(SLIDE)
- Who? Government (G) and Opposition (D)

What do they want? 
- To derive the benefits of holding office (office-seeking).

Both sets of actors are office-seeking (e.g. goal is to obtain the benefits of holding office)

'C' = Benefits of holding office
- pay for being in office, ability to reward supporters with jobs, control resources, extract bribes, etc

'R' = Value of holding onto office
- ability to protect yourself and supporters by controlling state and military

Remember, scientific models are like maps.
- Always wrong, sometimes useful.

### What do we think of the model?

### - Is it logical?

### - Is it convincing?

&lt;br&gt;

### How do we use this model to make predictions in the world?

Three testable implications of the model (p295)
1. "the most severe torturers" will sign the CAT
- Fig 1 p298
- More torture, more likely to sign CAT

2. authoritarian CAT signatories higher prob of survival than non-signatories
- Fig 2 p306
- Dark line shows risk of losing office for signatories, line is much, much lower than that for non-signatories

3. Opposition effort declines on CAT signing
- The data here is much tougher to unpack...
