We'll get to assigning groups and picking cases shortly, first I want us to discuss the big leap we make when moving from international law to an international organization.

Your reading for today from Hawkins, Lake, Nielson and Tierney (2006) covers the basic theoretical foundations you'll need to make this first argument.

HOW DO THE AUTHORS DEFINE DELEGATION?
(SLIDE)
(p4; “Delegation is a conditional grant of authority from a principal to an agent that empowers the latter to act on behalf of the former.”)

WHY ALWAYS GOVERNED BY A CONTRACT?
(Make the exact limits and expectations of the relationship clear for both sides)

WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO SAY THE DELEGATION MUCT BE REVOCABLE?
(Agents can be fired or else they are not agents)

HOW ARE THE ROLES MUTUALLY CONSTITUTIVE?
(Titles only have meaning as part of the relationship.)
- e.g. slave and master only true as long as relationship holds. 



WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF DELEGATING TO AN AGENT DISCUSSED IN THE CHAPTER?

]

???

GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE FROM THE CHAPTER OF EACH OF THESE IN ACTION.

(1. Divide the labor and create gains from specialization)
- frequent, repetitive tasks that require specific knowledge benefit from being delegated, agent gets better at them over time
- Create a specialized agent (ICC, World Bank, IMF)

(2. Managing policy externalities)
- Coordinating agent: coordination games (chicken game) the policy outcome doesn't matter as long as everyone does the same thing. Let the agent dictate.
- Collaboration agents: collaboration games (PD): States want to defect, delegate to an agent to provide the good for you or to monitor and publicize bad behavior. CoE monitors human rights.
- Coordinating agent (International Postal Union) 
- Collaboration agents (CoE, OECD, IAEA)

(3. Facilitating collective decision-making)
- Agenda-setting Agent: Agent with agenda setting power can help states get past vote cycling problems or other preference instabilities
- Basics of vote cycling: No condorcet winner (an option that beats all others in pairwise competition).
- agenda-setting agent (European Commission)

(4. Resolving disputes)
- Arbitrating agent: Incomplete contracting has lower future transaction costs if you create an arbitrating agent.
- Problems arise from incomplete contracting.
- Arrange careful rules so states can give the IO the authority AND autonomy to handle these unplanned for events.
- Arbitrating agents

(5. Enhancing credibility)
- Enforcing agents: with high discretion to push policy in the direction desired over the long-term. Makes it hard for states to cheat to grab short-term gains.
- time-inconsistency problem (long-term interests may not be same as short-term interests)
- Delegating authority to an IO is a demonstrable action that ties a state’s hands more than simple talk.
- Enforcing agents (ECB)

(6. Creating policy bias)
- Create lock-in with policy-biased agents
- Try to set the rules of behavior of the IO so that your power is protected even if the balance shifts over time.
- e.g. Post civil war create institutions with voting rules balanced across ethnic groups
- Policy creates winners and losers. Ensure your preferences remain in place long after you're gone.
- UNSC structure reflected power dynamics in 1945 but keeps them central today




ANY QUESTIONS ON THE BENEFITS?

These will play a big role in the first part of your case study.



Ok, so delegation can produce sizable benefits for agents.

THEN, ACCORDING TO THE READING, WHAT IS THE BIG PROBLEM?

("Agency slack")

WHAT IS AGENCY SLACK?
(p5; “...independent action by an agent that is undesired by the principal.”)

- EXAMPLE?
(I hire you to make sales calls and you play on Facebook all day long.)



The chapter defines two types of "slack."

1. WHAT IS "SHIRKING" AND GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE FROM YOUR WORK LIVES?
(“...when an agent minimizes the effort it exerts on its principal’s behalf.”)

Facebook time while at your desk.



2. WHAT IS SLIPPAGE AND GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE?
(“...when an agent shifts policy away from its principal’s preferred outcome and toward its own preference”)

I hire a realtor to help me buy a house at the lowest price.
- They get paid as a % of the selling price so their incentive is to keep the price higher than I'd like but low enough that I don't walk away.


EVERYBODY CLEAR ON THOSE FORMS OF AGENCY LOSS?

Now that we have the basic concepts down...

SLIDE

EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN THESE TWO FIGURES.


The primary benefit of delegation is in specialization.
- The agent gets really good at doing the job and you benefit.

The problem is that specialization only pays off if you give the agent the freedom to do the job.

As the agent's autonomy increases, the capacity for slack increases and eventually the agent's productivity collapses.

Game for the principal is to try and design a contract that maximizes productivity while minimizing slack.

DOES THIS MAKE SENSE?

ACCORDING TO THE READING, WHAT ARE THE FIVE MAJOR MECHANISMS STATES USE TO CONTROL THEIR AGENTS?

1. Rules vs Discretion

2. Monitoring and Reporting Requirements

3. Screening and Selection Procedures

4. Institutional Checks and Balances

5. Sanctions
]

???

HOW DO WE USE THE "RULES VS DISCRETION" DIFFERENCES TO CONTROL AN AGENT?
- How extensive and specific will the rules be for agent task execution?

- Entirely rule-based is inefficient and only needed when agent is difficult to control through other means (Ex: World Bank and the environment)

- Total discretion is better when uncertainty is very high, agent possesses important specialized knowledge or in cases of preference heterogeneity, BUT, trade-off is greater chance of slack.


HOW DO WE USE MONITORING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS TO CONTROL AN AGENT?
- "ex post" monitoring 
- "police patrol" is direct monitoring of agent by principals 
- "fire alarm" relies upon affected outside actors to make principals aware of a problem


HOW DO WE USE SCREENING AND SELECTION PROCEDURES TO CONTROL AN AGENT?
- Carefully pick agents whose preferences match your own.
- Of course, agents have an incentive to misrepresent their preferences...


HOW DO WE USE INSTITUTIONAL CHECKS AND BALANCES TO CONTROL AN AGENT?
- Design internal, conflicting authorities (UNSC can stop ICC)
- empower more than one agent with overlapping authorities


HOW DO WE USE SANCTIONS TO CONTROL AN AGENT?
- Carrots and sticks
- Increase or decrease budgets, perks, staff, degree of oversight
- Control mechanisms are costly and imperfect
