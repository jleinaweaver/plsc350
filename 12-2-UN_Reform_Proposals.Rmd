Let's reform the UN! Find us a published argument that proposes a specific reform of the United Natons (e.g. changes in the power of the GA, the use of the veto in the SC, the membership of the SC, how peacekeeping gets paid for and staffed, how the UN budget is paid for, etc.). Make sure you can explain how, in specific terms, this reform would work, why it would be beneficial and how you might convince the members of the UN to accept the reform. No overlap in specific proposal!

Bring to class a proposal of a specific reform of the UN (e.g. changes in the power of the GA, the use of the veto in the SC, the membership of the SC, peacekeeping, budgeting, etc.). 
- How specifically would it work?
- Why would it beneficial? To whom?
- Why is it a feasible change? How would you sell it?

Articles you found that are relevant
1. Reform the Veto
- Keaten (2018): "...outgoing U.N. human rights chief said Monday that the Security Council’s five permanent members wield too much power at the United Nations, warning the imbalance must change to avert possible “collapse” of the world body “at great cost to the international community.”
- Wenaweser & Alavi (2020). Innovating to Restrain the Use of the Veto in the United Nations Security Council): Very concisely lays out two "reasonable" reforms of the veto power: 1) The ACT Code of Conduct limits the veto for genocide/war crimes/crimes against humanity, 2) GA oversight of vetos
- The ACT code of conduct: U.N. Doc. A/70/621–S/2015/978
- The “French/Mexican initiative”: Link 1
2. Membership Reforms
- G4 (2006) A/60/L.46: Adds 6 PNVM seats (permanent non-veto members), 4 non-permanent with regional representation baked in
- AU (1995) UN GA A/59/L.67 proposal to add seats AND extend the veto
3. Strengthen the GA

4. Defense of the status quo (US perspective)
- Abrams (2021) Biden Is Working to Undermine America’s Authority at the U.N.

“Uniting for Consensus” Group proposal: Adds a bunch of non-permanent, no veto states bc they argue adding permanent members creates independent power sources
- "Seventy-seven years of UN history “shows permanent members are accountable only to themselves,” Massari said. A new permanent member would only “expand the club of privilege, or oligopoly.” https://www.passblue.com/2023/02/14/italy-is-hopeful-about-un-reform-as-long-as-its-proposal-leads-the-way/

https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11127-017-0468-2
Brainstorming Topics:
- Abolish the SC / transfer powers to the GA
- Make all UNSC seats non-permanent?
- What criteria should we use to decide who is permanent on the SC?
- Debate each of the most likely candidates: Germany, India, Brazil, Japan, ?
- Should the French seat go the EU?
