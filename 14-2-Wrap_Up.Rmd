### Prep for Class
1. IDEA Eval Day

2. Post assignment prompt on Canvas

<br>

Today I want to wrap up our semester and get you working on the final paper

- **SLIDE**: But first, IDEA evals

Groups, based on our work of the semester, give us a definition of international law.

- If you were explaining international law to someone else, what would you tell them?

"International law is that law that the .textred[**wicked do not obey**] and the .textblue[**righteous do not enforce**]" (Eban 1957).

".textred[**International law**] is to law what .textblue[**professional wrestling**] is to wrestling" (Stephen Budiansky).

"....textred[**almost**] all nations observe .textred[**almost**] all principles of international law and .textred[**almost**] all of their obligations .textred[**almost**] all the time" (Henkin 1979).

### Given our work of the semester, how do you now evaluate these three descriptions of international law that we started the semester with?

<br>

### Do you agree or disagree with the deeply cynical take of Eban (1957)?

<br>

### What about Budiansky? Is this AS cynical as Eban's take?

<br>

Henkin's is the most accurate, no?

.size55[.content-box-blue[**Do international institutions matter?**]]

???

Let's go back to the big academic debate we used to kick off the semester.

- Do international institutions matter?

<br>

Realists argue: International institutions "have minimal influence on state behavior" (Mearsheimer p7).

<br>

Rational Designers and Institutionalists argue: States design international institutions to facilitate and strengthen international cooperation (KLS 2001).

<br>

My desire is not that you join an ideological team

- I NEVER advocate that

- Theories are tools that are sometimes useful, none of them are ALWAYS useful

<br>

**SLIDE**: My goal is that you understand when the realist predictions are more accurate and when the institutionalists are more accurate

Write a report that identifies, analyzes and attempts to address a significant problem using an international institution.

1. What is the problem and why is it important?

2. Find an example of an international institution that has sought to address this problem in the past. What did it do and how effective was it?

3. Based on the tools we've explored (legalization, the rational design conjectures and PA theory) and the cases we've analyzed, what specific elements would you suggest for the design of a new international institution meant to address your chosen problem?
