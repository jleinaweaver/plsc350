I'm Dr. Leinaweaver.

### Your turn!
+ Name, year, major and do you have any experience reading/studying laws (domestic or international)?

<br>

Ok, let's see where we are starting our explorations this term.

- I'd like to get a sense of your "prior knowledge" concerning international law.

- Don't worry if you don't have clear prior knowledge, let's just talk through our intuitions.

Ok, let's repeat this for a second question.

### When do states act on the international level?

### - In other words, what specific conditions motivate state action? 

Take a few minutes on your own to think about this.

The question for us this semester is, should international law or international organizations be on either of these lists?

- In other words, does international law matter for understanding international politics?

One common theme you might come across in response to this question is summed up nicely by the Former Foreign Affairs Minister of Israel

### What is this as an answer to our question?

### - Is Eban telling us international law and organizations matter or not?

"....textred[**almost**] all nations observe .textred[**almost**] all principles of international law and .textred[**almost**] all of their obligations .textred[**almost**] all the time."

--- Louis Henkin (1979) 
]

???

The distinguished international legal scholar Louis Henkin famously wrote: 

"...almost all nations observe almost all principles of international law and almost all of their obligations almost all the time."

- Take a second and think about this sentence fragment.

<br>

### If this was the only thing you knew about international law, what could you say about it?

1. (Target of the law appears to be nations. e.g. States.)

2. (International law, at least according to legal scholars, carries obligations for those states.)

3. (International law seems to matter at least some of the time.)

4. (There are some conditions when states break international law.)
    - Be a good idea to figure out what those conditions areâ€¦

My attendance policy is simple.

The only way I can ensure everyone makes progress on the LOs is by being in class and doing the work.

- This means I have to make sure you are here!

<br>

To help encourage you I use an attendance cliff.

- Anyone with more than THREE unexcused absences in the semester cannot earn higher than a â€˜Câ€™ in the course

- Regardless of grades earned on other assignments.

### Questions on this?

What if you have an excused absence coming up?

- It is your responsibility to email me **BEFORE** the absence in order to receive a make-up assignment.

- Easy peasy

<br>

This is also the place where I say to you, whatever is going on that might keep you out of class, please keep me in the loop. 

- I genuinely want you to make progress on our learning outcomes

<br>

So, if things are getting rough for you please come talk to me.

**I will always offer you flexibility in the face of struggle IF YOU COME TO ME BEFORE DEADLINES HAVE PASSED!**

### Fair enough?

class: slideblue

???

Ok, so I've got you coming to class now how do I make sure you're engaged?

- Participation points!

<br>

Basically, if you:

- Get to class on time,

- Have the materials you need to work, and

- Submit all daily required assignments BEFORE class,

You'll be good to go and these are easy free points.

<br>

Before almost every class we will have a reading and a discussion question.

- You must submit your answer to that question on our Canvas discussion board BEFORE class begins to earn your participation point.

<br>

The two most common ways people lose these points?

- Come to class late, or 

- Come to class without having completed the daily assignment.

Your first job is to download the syllabus from Canvas and read it carefully.

It includes detail on everything you need to know.
- Assignment deadlines
- Readings
- Drury policies
- Office hours

ALSO, I can see who downloaded it, so donâ€™t delay!

<br>

We'll be using Canvas for submitting assignments, posting to the discussions and accessing the class readings.

- Let me know if you have trouble accessing our materials on Canvas.

Speaking of Canvas!

- ALL of the assigned readings are available on Canvas in the "Modules" section.

<br>

The syllabus includes many web links, but if they don't work I have uploaded backups onto Canvas.

- ALL of the assigned readings should be on Canvas

- Please let me know BEFORE class if you ever can't find an assigned reading.

<br>

SLIDE: Now, how do you earn your participation point for Friday?
