We kicked things off two weeks ago with the very first major global climate treaty: the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change

<br>

The UNFCCC is the convention that sets the stage for the all of the UN climate treaties to come

### What were the three important legacies of the UNFCCC that we highlighted in class?

<br>

1. The ultimate objective of the global effort
    - Article 2 clearly states the "ultimate objective": "...prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system" BUT your economy matters too!

2. The principles guiding our efforts
    - Article 3 lays out the key principles that were selected to guide our efforts
    - States should act to protect the system, BUT must also protect the developing world and protect economic development

3. Who is "rich" enough to mitigate emissions and pay for the global effort
    - States listed in Annex I and II represent the "rich" world who are responsible to do the most and help pay for the efforts of the developing world.

<br>

A substantial framing exercise PLUS the UNFCCC creates the outline of what could become important delegated agents in the future.

- e.g. The science and advisory committee, the Clean Development Mechanism, etc

We then jumped forward to the Kyoto Protocol (1998)!

- The Kyoto Protocol represented our first substantial attempt to mandate actual emissions cuts

<br>

### What were our takeaways from analyzing the design of the Kyoto Protocol?

<br>

A top-down approach to achieving cuts, BUT
- Only cutting emissions in the developed world,
    
- Some developed states received VERY generous targets,
    
- Specific processes for accounting and measuring actual emissions left TBD,
    
- Penalties for not meeting targets applied to second period, BUT
    - No second period actually agreed in KP

<br>

### Despite these critiques, what did we find in the data?

### - Was the Kyoto Protocol effective?

<br>

```

???

Ignoring the USA (non-participant), the majority of Annex B states did in fact cut their emissions!

- 72% of Annex B states cut their 1990 emissions by 2012

- 50% cut greater than 10%

- 25% cut more than 27%!

<br>

The Kyoto Protocol is a flawed agreement in many ways, BUT it pushed the "ball" forward in a meaningful way on global climate action and that's not nothing!

- **SLIDE**: In fact, international law has a way of influencing behavior even for non-participants

Since the Paris Agreement is our currently operating global treaty I wanted to bring us up to date on the science of the problem

- At least, per the global consensus generated by the IPCC

<br>

### Remind me, who is the IPCC and why should we listen to them?

- From their "About" page: "The IPCC currently has 195 members. Thousands of people from all over the world contribute to the work of the IPCC. For the assessment reports, experts volunteer their time as IPCC authors to assess the thousands of scientific papers published each year to provide a comprehensive summary of what is known about the drivers of climate change, its impacts and future risks, and how adaptation and mitigation can reduce those risks. An open and transparent review by experts and governments around the world is an essential part of the IPCC process, to ensure an objective and complete assessment and to reflect a diverse range of views and expertise. Through its assessments, the IPCC identifies the strength of scientific agreement in different areas and indicates where further research is needed. The IPCC does not conduct its own research."

<br>

Obviously our scientific understanding has changed over the 28 years between these reports, but it is useful for us to consider how the political consensus reflects that evolution

*SKIP GROUP WORK*

### As we look across these two reports, what stands out as the biggest developments in the political and scientific consensus around climate change?

**SLIDE**: Let's look at how the emissions have changed

So, this is where the world found itself post-Kyoto. 

### How are these changes likely to change the political dynamics of negotiating a new global climate treaty?

- Some cuts happening amongst the OECD/Annex B countries (although not huge)

- Emissions remaining high in developed countries, and

- Emissions growing rapidly in the global south

### How does the PA blend a bottom-up and a top-down approach to institution building?

- (countries set own goals BUT int'l community oversight and pushing you to ratchet up pledges every five years)

- "The new climate deal is a laissez-faire accord among nations that leaves the content of domestic policy to governments but creates international legal obligations to develop, implement, and regularly strengthen actions" (2).

<br>

### Who are Dimitrov's "winners" and "losers" from the PA? In terms of countries and ideas?

Dimitrov argues that the PA generally favors developed countries of the North.

- Basically a pledge and review system (first proposed by Japan in the 1990s. (8)

- 4.2: All States - Specific domestic mitigation measures (policies)
- 4.3: All States - Highest possible ambition BUT CBDR + national circumstances
- 4.4: Developed only - economy-wide absolute emission reduction targets
- 4.4: Developing only - "enhance" efforts, "encouraged" to set targets
- 4.5: Developing only - Ambition can be contingent on financing
- 4.7: All - adaptation co-benefits count as mitigation
- 4.8: All - Provide all needed info for "clarity, transparency and understanding"

There are SO MANY moving parts to the PA that effectiveness depends entirely on what part of the treaty you are evaluating!

<br>

1. Are countries submitting NDCs?
    - Are they on time?
    - Do they represent the highest ambition (given CBDR)?

2. Is the COP developing the metrics needed to evaluate the NDCs?
    - Is the global stock-take on track?
    
3. Is the developed world meeting its financing goals to assist the developing world in mitigation and adaptation?

4. Are countries actually implementing the policies they have proposed?

5. Are countries hitting the emissions targets they have pledged to hit?
    - You might take all the proposed actions and still not hit your estimated targets!

6. Over Time: Are second submission NDCs ratcheted up in ambition?

<br>

### Make sense?

Let's start by reporting back on your NDCs in a purely descriptive sense

- We'll get to analyzing them in a moment

<br>

### How much did your NDCs vary by length?

### - Who had very long NDCs and who short?

<br>

### How complex or thorough were the documents?

### - Full of citations to specific laws and supporting materials or not?

<br>

### Give me examples of what sound like substantial commitments from your NDCs.

<br>

### Did anybody find language in their NDCs that functioned like a treaty reservation or the creation of a loophole?

### - Anything that maybe weakened the commitments in the document?

<br>

### Who saw a lot of change between different NDC submissions by a single country?

### - Examples of change?

Report Back!

### Do you agree with the coding in the the CW database re your NDCs? Why or why not?

<br>

Ok, let's say someone came to you looking for data on the global climate negotiations

### Would you feel confident recommending the summaries on the CW database as a good source of this data?

### - In other words, does it represent the key variation in your NDCs well enough?

First thing to know is that we developed a coding dictionary that would allow us to capture the variation in each NDC by what it emphasized

- Each NDC is summarized by the amount it emphasizes each of these themes or topics

<br>

We developed this dictionary through a fairly extensive process including:
- reviewing the established literature, 

- interviewing country representatives who negotiated the KP and PA, and 

- reading and reflecting on the NDCs themselves.

**NOTE TO YOU: NLP dictionary is a little bit different than thematic dictionary**

<br>

This dot plot shows you the average emphases in the first submission NDCs.

- The top rows represent those topics receiving the largest emphases

- So, states generally emphasized topics of environmental vulnerability, the need for renewable energy and a demand for new international governance.

- At the other end of the scale there was very little emphasis on waste, a need for nuclear energy and criticisms of capitalism

<br>

I know that last one sounds weird but members of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of our America (ALBA) used their first NDCs to vent about capitalism.

- Antigua and Barbuda, Bolivia, Cuba, Dominica, Grenada, Nicaragua, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, St Vincent and the Grenadines and Venezuela

<br>

**SLIDE**: What's really cool is what we found in the shift from first submission to second submission NDCs

Rather than averages I'm showing you box plots.

- This way you can compare much more of the variation in country NDCs

- Blue boxes are topics that increased their median level of emphasis, red boxes shrank 

<br>

Importantly what we see is a strong increase in the proportion of NDCs focused on:

- setting mitigation targets, 

- demanding verification of emissions cuts, and 

- a need to engage with our civic communities (human rights, vulnerability and non-state actors)

<br>

I'll bet you saw the first submission NDCs you reviewed were typically much more expansive and varied than the second submissions.

<br>

**SLIDE**: The news about targets and verification is also widespread!

Targets and verification scatter plot

<br>

Of the 133 states that have submitted two NDCs:

- 115 have increased their emphases on the verification topic (86%).

- 107 have increased their emphases on the emissions target topic (80%).

<br>

### Any notable outliers from this increased ambition?

- (Dammit America)
    - Although part of that is we (and New Zealand) already focused heavily on these topics!

<br>

So, some good news!

Thematic Factors line plots side by side

In this section the factor analyses are performed separately on the first and second NDC submissions. This allows us to visualize the topic loadings within each set of submissions.

Figure 9 focuses on Factor 1 across the two NDC submissions. Factor 1 explains 16% of the cumulative variation in the first NDC submissions and 14% in the second. This dimension is fairly stable across the two submissions in terms of the topics that load most heavily on it. We define this factor as a divide between those states focusing on developing international governance (with a key aim of centralizing emissions targets) and those focusing on developing domestic governance (in response to vulnerability concerns).

Figure 10 focuses on Factor 2 across the two NDC submissions. Factor 2 explains 13% of the cumulative variation in the first NDC submissions and 12% in the second. This is the dimension apparently most impacted by the dramatic rise in the proportion of state NDCs focusing on setting mitigation targets and creating the international governance structures needed to further cooperation on climate change. In NDC Submission 1 the factor analysis reveals a dimension divided between states that provided different reasons to contextualize their (possibly too low) emission mitigation targets (e.g. environmental vulnerability vs concerns over sovereignty or a need to grow economically). In NDC Submission 2 the factor analysis reveals a dimension rooted in the same starting place as in Factor 1 (mitigation targets and international governance), but the opposite end is now dominated by domestic concerns over market mechanisms, a defense of sovereignty and to a slightly lesser extent agricultural issues. The emphasis in environmental vulnerability has appeared to diminish significantly in these second round NDC submissions.

FA States map after k means clustering NDC 1

The move from NDC 1 (Figure 12) to NDC 2 (Figure 13) shows what appears to be a tightening in the clusters of countries involved in the negotiations.

K-means clustering can be used to quantify this visual pattern across the state groupings. Using the FA scores for each state as the input and setting the k-means clustering algorithm to estimate three clusters shows a dramatic tightening of the clusters when moving from the first to the second NDC submissions. Specifically, the three clusters are more evenly distributed and the with-cluster sum of squares is reduced.

The K-Means clusters estimated using only the first submission NDCs place countries in three groups:

States focused primarily on domestic growth policies (Factor 1 = .2, Factor 2 = 1.2)
States that load somewhat equally on the need for domestic governance policies and a concern for their environmental vulnerability (Factor 1 = .5, Factor 2 = -.6)
States focused primarily on international governance policies (Factor 1 = -1.6, Factor 2 = -.1)

FA States map after k means clustering NDC 1

The K-Means clusters estimated using only the second submission NDCs place countries in three much tighter, better defined groups:

The cluster focused on domestic growth policies has seen an increase in their load on international governance issues (Factor 1 = -.3, Factor 2 = 1.1)
The cluster previously split by domestic governance and vulnerability now loads more heavily on domestic governance and replaces vulnerability with a small load on international governance (Factor 1 = .9, Factor 2 = -.3)
The cluster focused on international governance policies remains so focused across both factors (Factor 1 = -.9, Factor 2 = -.9)
