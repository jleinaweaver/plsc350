Submit a report that describes and analyzes an international organization.

1. Why was this international organization created? (e.g. what problem was it designed to address and why is the problem important?)

2. In what specific ways was the foundational treaty of your selected international organization designed to provide the "benefits" of delegation? Be sure to consider PA Theory, Legalization and the Rational Design literatures.

3. How effective has the organization been in addressing the problem that motivated its creation?

Next week we dive into international institutions designed for Coordination

- aka How do we get states to do something specific?

<br>

We'll start this section by analyzing the United Nations

- I like to start these sections with real world implications hence the assignment for Tuesday
