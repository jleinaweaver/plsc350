### Prep for Class
1. ...

<br>

This week we've begun exploring international institutions for aggregate effort.

<br>

### Refresh my memory, what is an aggregate effort institution?
- (By aggregate effort we mean outcomes that depend on the contributions of all states)

- For our work, we'll be analyzing international institutions focused on fighting climate change

???

We started by discussing three of the important legacies of the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change

<br>

### What three important elements did we note were established in that treaty?

1. Article 2 clearly states the "ultimate objective": "...prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system"

2. Article 3 lays out the key principles that were selected to guide our efforts
    - States should act to protect the system, BUT must also protect the developing world and protect economic development

3. States listed in Annex I and II represent the "rich" world who are responsible to do the most and help pay for the efforts of the developing world.

<br>

A substantial framing exercise PLUS the UNFCCC creates the outline of what could become important delegated agents in the future.

### Everybody ready to go?

### - Are you getting more comfortable thinking about data?

### - Manipulating a spreadsheet?

<br>

In essence, I see this list as the kinds of data analyses we would need to perform if we wanted to write a research paper analyzing the effectiveness of the Kyoto Protocol

- Specifically, I think we would need to establish three broad arguments

<br>

To do this I'm going to put you in NEW groups!

The first important task for our research paper would be to make clear that the outcome data we have is appropriate for the research question we are trying to answer.

- "Appropriate" is both a theoretical AND an empirical problem.

<br>

**In terms of theory** we need to make an argument that the specific actions required by the Kyoto Protocol (e.g. financing, technology transfers, greater reporting of emissions, etc.) would lead to actual cuts in emissions

### GROUPS, do you believe the sum of the climate actions required by the Kyoto Protocol will produce changes in emissions levels? Why or why not?

In terms of empirics: We need to demonstrate that our chosen outcome variable, changes in emissions, actually varies across the states in the sample.

<br>

If all the states essentially produce the same changes, then there's nothing for us to explain

- In other words, we couldn't show any effect of the Kyoto Protocol because the states behaved the same regardless of the treaty

*Figure from Worldometers*

<br>

### Vital note: You must always investigate your outliers

- If there is an error, fix it or remove it

- If the observation is outside the scope of the study, address it

<br>

- [Per OPEC](https://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/about_us/4319.htm), Equitorial Guinea discovered its massive oil reserves only in 1996.

- Only in 1993 did they begin extracting oil at significant levels (a few million barrels per year)

- 2006-2007 went from 12m to 1.1 billion barrels per year!

- [Per IMF](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2006/cr06233.pdf) the economy has exploded since then!

<br>

### So, do we need to remove Equitorial Guinea?

### - Is it outside the scope of the question or not?

<br>

I lean towards saying to remove it.

- This oil discovery was completely unexpected, massively distortionary and all happened AFTER the Kyoto negotiation.

- Not sure we should critique a treaty for failing to deal with a problem that didn't exist when it was designed

Our top ten lists show us that there is a significant difference between the two extremes, but 

- This doesn't answer the question about whether or not this variable is empirically appropriate across the whole range of states

- The extremes can differ while the bulk of observations cluster together in the middle and that would still be a problem

<br>

This is a histogram of emissions changes in the dataset.

### Remind me, what is a histogram?
- (A bar plot for numeric data with counts of binned numbers)

<br>

So, this shows us the variation in the outcome variable across all of the observations.

- Let's analyze this visualization

<br>

### First, simply describe for me what you see here.

This can be tough to analyze given how extreme the outlier is.

```

???

States differ quite a bit on this measure which gives us a lot to work with.

- This variation means we can usefully ask, does the Kyoto Protocol explain the differences betweeen the 33% who make cuts and the 66% who don't?

<br>

**SLIDE**: We can also visualize the emissions after grouping them using a map.

Here I've created three groups:

1. Those who cut their emissions relative to 1990 are in blue

2. Emissions increases up to 100% (doubling) are in orange, and

3. Emissions above 100% are in red.

<br>

Note that I am not creating these groups based on the Annex B thresholds.

- My interest here was to see if emissions are going down, not if the arbitrary thresholds are being met.

<br>

### Any surprises on this map? Anything of note?

<br>

### So, bottom line, are we convinced that emissions changes represent an appropriate  way to measure countries actions on climate change in both theoretical and empirical terms? Why or why not?

<br>

Alright, everybody stand up and find a new group!

- Go!

Our final piece of the argument is to see if the data shows Annex B states do in fact take the lead on emissions cuts.

The first thing these authors test is "commitment" to the UNFCCC and KP.

- They construct an indicator for each that combines the ratification dummy with a measure of ratification 

<br>

They argue the conclusion of this is that states committed "more" to the UNFCCC than to the Kyoto Protocol

Next the authors examine how well states have met their reporting obligations.

- Per Art 12.1 of the UNFCCC: Each member must regularly submit a "National Communication (NC)" about the development of its anthropogenic emissions and the national steps taken or envisaged for climate protection"

- This indicator measures whether and how fast each member state submitted its most recent report.

They argue the conclusion of this is that states don't tend to meet their reporting obligations

Simon Kuznets was an economist who studied economic inequality in the 50s and 60s.

- His hypothesis: economic development and economic inequality follow an inverted U-shaped relationship

- As an economy grows from the beginning, inequality grows too.

- At a certain point economic growth stops driving inequality and eventually additional growth begins to shrink that inequality.

- The micro-causes of this aren't always clear, but the general idea is that rising wealth and standards of living lead to demands by the population for more services and better amenities.

<br>

### Does that make sense?

Somewhat later on, other economists began to apply this logic to models of pollution.

- As incomes rose so too does pollution until a certain level is reached and then societal demands for a cleaner environment get louder.

- Eventually, regulations follow and future economic growth actually lowers pollution.

<br>

A ton of literature exists debating the EKC and trying to find evidence of it all over the place.

- The general takeaway has been that this trend seems to occur but primarily just on pollutants that are visible and most costly (e.g. smog, lake or river pollution leading to fish kills or sickness, etc.).

<br>

### Does the basic intuition make sense?

### Is it clear why the ekc only seems to work for some types of pollution and not others?

What these authors did was model the EKC for CO2 emissions in 13 EU states across time (1870-2002).

- They calculated an EU average for each year and then modeled it using a cubic polynomial function.

<br>

And, indeed, it does seem to show an inverted U relationship.

- So, first of all, that's pretty cool to see!

<br>

They used this to establish a baseline of development.

- Countries could be compared to this trend line to see if they are developing a cleaner economy faster than the EU did.

- In other words, given your current level of development is your country emitting more or fewer CO2 emissions than the avg of these EU 13 at a comparable point in their development?

Technically, they do this comparison two ways.

- First, the "level" component compares your current emissions (1990-1992) to the EU's EKC.

- Second, the "trend" component compares the slope of your line from 1990 to 2002 to the EU's slope over that time period.

### Questions on this?

That brings us back to their results which, they argue, show:

- Developing states appear to be doing their part

- Among the 16 lowest assessed countries (score (0.2) there are five OPEC states (Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Libia, and Iraq) and five AI countries (Australia, Canada, United States, Belgium, and Finland), but no LDC.

<br>

### All in all, how good did we do with our tests as compared to this published research?

<br>

Pretty good, right?!

<br>

### Bottom line, was the Kyoto Protocol effective?

- A mixed bag

- Not sure how much credit it should get for poor countries staying poor...

- On the other hand, our data does show evidence of emissions cuts
