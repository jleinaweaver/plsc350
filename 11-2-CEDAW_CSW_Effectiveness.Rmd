Setting up our aim for this week: How effective is the UN at establishing global standards of behavior? 
- A continuation of our analyses from last Thursday. 

- Specifically, explore CEDAW as a case study of UN delegation in action. 

- Is this evidence that the UN can achieve substantial things for the world?

Give the class a warning about the Horne, Robinson & Lloyd (2020)

- The UN has a serious problem with allegations of crimes and exploitation in its peacekeeping operations.

- Some of these crimes include those of a sexual nature and can be pretty tough to read about.

- The article I've chosen studies the crimes in more broad strokes not fine details but I wanted to give you a head's up.

- The theory sections is totally safe but the introduction tries to help you see why this is a big deal and that subject is a tough one.

- Also, give me a head's up before next class if you have concerns about digging into this literature. I can make sure you are in a different group.
