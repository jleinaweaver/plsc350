We are exploring the academic debate about international institutions.

- For our purposes we are essentially contrasting the "Realists" with the "Rational Designers"

<br>

Last class we examined Mearsheimer's argument that international institutions "have minimal influence on state behavior."

### What were the key premises in that argument?

- Powerful states create institutions to maintain or increase their power

- Institutions simply reflect the balance of power

- When the balance of power shifts so too should the institutions

Therefore, international institutions "have minimal influence on state behavior" (7).

### How well did our cases in class provide confidence for us in these assumptions?

### - Strongest assumptions?

### - Weakest assumptions?

<br>

### According to this argument, when should we expect states to create new international institutions?
- (Powerful states create institutions to maintain or increase their power (13))

Last week we discussed the striking similarities in the ways domestic and international law are organized and evaluated.

- Both a mix of written rules on top of customary rules

- Both depend on enforcement and adjudication

<br>

### With our "failure" cases considered, can you tell me in what specific ways international and domestic law are different from each other?

1. (states must CHOOSE to bind themselves)
    - Ratify a treaty, or develop customary law
    - Not true of the laws we live under!

2. (Punishment for violators is DEEPLY uncertain)
    - In domestic law it is only somewhat uncertain!

3. (Violations of international law may lead to punishment OR to changes in the law itself!)
    - Getting caught for speeding repeatedly NEVER leads to an increase in speed limits just for you.

<br>

Today's reading on the rational design of international institutions will help us add even more things to the "how are they similar" list!

- Koremenos, Lipson and Snidal have been part of a number of hugely influential research projects.
    - In fact, we'll be seeing their names again next week.

- These three are SUPER smart and this paper has opened up a huge and interesting research agenda into international institutions.

<br>

### What is the central conclusion of the KLS article you read for today?

### - How do they answer the question, do international institutions matter?

### How does this new definition alter our understanding of the key concept?

### - How is it different from North's or Mearsheimer's?

Mearsheimer 
- uses the word rules but really what he means is power.

- Rules are constructed and enforced by the powerful.

- Their influence over state behavior cannot meaningfully be understood in the absence of powerful states.

Koremenos, Lipson and Snidal
- Explicitly focused on the international level (differs from North)

- Arrangements can be created by "international actors," not just states.

- These arrangements can be seen as holding power OVER those actors (compel or forbid action).

- AND meaningful authority can be delegated to an agent (e.g. authorize!) who then acts on the same level as states

Starting on p780 KLS give us these four "Conjectures About Rational Design" which represent the key assumptions underpinning their key conclusion.

1. What does this assumption mean?

### Examples from your "success" cases that support this assumption?

Let's compare and contrast with Mearsheimer's offensive realist argument.

### How much overlap is there across these assumptions?
- (A lot!)

- states are strategic

- cooperation is hard (due to anarchy and uncertainty)

- States are risk averse and fear their choices may come back to destroy them

<br>

### How are they distinctly different?
- (Rational Design assumes that survival is not the only goal)

- (Rational Design acknowledges the importance of time and repeated interactions in calculating benefits)

<br>

### Based on your case studies this week, which set of assumptions better sets us up to explain state behavior on the international level? Why?

This takes us to the heart of this paper, the rational design conjectures
- summarized by Table 1 (p797) but are explored in the bulk of the text

<br>

Remember, their argument assumes that states intentionally use institutional design to make cooperation possible.
- These conjectures lay out a series of ways that can be accomplished

- Each conjecture ties a specific design to a specific problem

- So, if the area of cooperation is complicated by a serious enforcement problem, M1 tells us to consider restricting the membership of the institution

<br>

**SLIDE**: The design choices

???

The paper focuses on five specific design choices
- Not meant as an exhaustive list, but pretty darn thorough.

<br>

When designing an institution you can:

1. Adjust your membership rules to be more inclusive or more restrictive

2. Adjust the scope of the issues covered to be broad or narrow

3. Adjust the centralization of tasks (more vs less)

4. Adjust the rules for controlling the institution, and

5. Offer states who participate some flexibility in the arrangements

<br>

**SLIDE**: These design choices are made in order to address or overcome specific problems that arise in cooperation

background-image: url('libs/Images/03_2-KLS_Table1a.png')
background-size: 80%

???

KLS identify four broad problems that complicate efforts to achieve international cooperation (p773-780)

1. How will the agreement be enforced?

2. How will uncertainty be overcome?
    - (3 flavors: preferences, behavior, and the state of the world)

3. Who should be invited to participate? (Number)

4. And how should disputes over the distribution of benefits be addressed?

<br>

**SLIDE**: I'd like us to explore each of these design mechanisms in more detail, but beginning with the problems and not the designs.

### Questions on the assignment?

- Go!

<br>

<br>

#### Notes
p763
Membership rules ( MEMBERSHIP )
- "Who belongs to the institution? Is membership exclusive and restrictive, like the G-7’s limitation to rich countries? Or is it inclusive by design, like the UN? Is it regional, like ASEAN, or is it universal? Is it restricted to states, or can NGOs join?" (770).

Scope of issues covered ( SCOPE )
- "What issues are covered?" (770).

Centralization of tasks ( CENTRALIZATION )
- "Are some important institutional tasks performed by a single focal entity or not? Scholars often misleadingly equate centralization with centralized enforcement. We use the term more broadly to cover a wide range of centralized activities. In particular we focus on centralization to disseminate information, to reduce bargaining and transaction costs, and to enhance enforcement" (771).

Rules for controlling the institution ( CONTROL )
- "How will collective decisions be made? Control is determined by a range of factors, including the rules for electing key officials and the way an institution is financed. We focus on voting arrangements as one important and observable aspect of control" (772).

Flexibility of arrangements ( FLEXIBILITY )
- "How will institutional rules and procedures accommodate new circumstances? Institutions may confront unanticipated circumstances or shocks, or face new demands from domestic coalitions or clusters of states wanting to change important rules or procedures. What kind of flexibility does an institution allow to meet such challenges?" (773).

Ok, everybody think about their "failed" cases from last class.

- I have made a big list available on Canvas that you can pick from.

- You're welcome to find something else but the treaty you pick must be multilateral and not be one we are analyzing in class this semester

<br>

**SLIDE**: Your report will have three sections

1. Why was this treaty created? (e.g. what problem was it designed to address and why is the problem important?)

2. What specifically does it do? Describe the design of the treaty using the dimensions of legalization and the rational design conjectures

3. How effective has the treaty been in addressing the problem that motivated its creation?
]

???

### Questions on the three sections?

<br>

Now, I'm going to ask you to attack this assignment in small groups (3-4 people?)

- Each group will focus on the same treaty

- Your group means you have other people helping you research

- Ultimately, it is your paper but the prep will be distributed

<br>

Let's figure out how to split the class into groups and pick treaties.

- Then we'll talk about your assignment for Tuesday

2. Provide and explain one piece of evidence that helps you make the argument in Section 1 of the paper (Why was this treaty created?). Be sure to cite the evidence in APA format

3. Based on your answer above, explain which of the KLS cooperation problems are likely to impact the design of your treaty (e.g. enforcement, uncertainty, number, and distribution)
