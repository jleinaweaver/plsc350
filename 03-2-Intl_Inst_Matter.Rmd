One of the takeaways I hope you are getting from these first four weeks is just how different international law is from domestic law.

FROM WHAT WE'VE STUDIED SO FAR, GIVE ME REASONS THESE TWO THINGS ARE SO DIFFERENT.

(1. states must CHOOSE to bind themselves)
- Ratify a treaty, or
- develop customary law

(2. Punishment for violators is DEEPLY uncertain)

(3 .Violations are as likely to lead to changes in the law as they are to punishment)

- Getting caught for speeding repeatedly NEVER leads to an increase in speed limits just for you.




I'm glad we're starting to get there.

Recognizing the substantial differences is vital to studying and understanding the big effects of international law on people, states and the world.

HOWEVER, it turns out that domestic and international laws also do share much in common and that's what our reading for today should help us understand better.




Ok, give me a refresher from last week.

FOR MEARSHEIMER, WHAT ROLE DO INSTITUTIONS PLAY ON THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL?

**if needed**: WHY IS THEIR INFLUENCE SO MINIMAL?

- International anarchy
- States have offensive military capacity
- Uncertainty re: intentions of other states

- States are strategic
- **Powerful states create institutions to maintain or increase their power**

Therefore, international institutions don't matter.
]

???

(1. Powerful states create institutions to maintain or increase their power (13).)

(2. Institutions simply reflect the balance of power)
- Balance of power is the key predictor, institutions are just one place those pressures play out.
- balance of power explains war, institutions just an intervening variable.
- e.g. NATO was a tool used by the US to manage its interests in Europe, however, it is really just the manifestation of a bipolar system.

(3. When the balance of power shifts so too should the institutions)


REFLECTING ON MEARSHEIMER'S ARGUMENT PLUS OUR CASE STUDIES OVER THE LAST TWO WEEKS, HOW PERSUASIVE DO YOU FIND THIS ARGUMENT?

- STRENGTHS?

- WEAKNESSES?

Today I'd like us to explore and evaluate an alternative model.

Koremenos, Lipson and Snidal have been part of a number of hugely influential research projects.
- In fact, we'll be seeing their names again next week.

These three are SUPER smart and this paper has opened up a huge and interesting research agenda into international institutions.

Bottom line argument: Therefore, states design international institutions to facilitate and strengthen international cooperation.

We'll need to draw on everything we've read and discussed so far in the class in order to evaluate the KLS argument




Let's start by discussing our definition of international institutions.

HOW DOES KLS DEFINE INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS?

- WHAT IS PRESCRIBE?
(state authoritatively or as a rule that (an action or procedure) should be carried out.)
- To compel a behavior
- Do this

- PROSCRIBE?
(forbid)
- Don't do this

- AUTHORIZE?
(give official permission for or approval to (an undertaking or agent))
- Create an agent to do this.

???

HOW DOES THIS NEW DEFINITION ALTER OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE KEY CONCEPT?

- HOW IS IT DIFFERENT FROM NORTH'S OR MEARSHEIMER'S?


Mearsheimer uses the word rules but really what he means is power.
- Rules are constructed and enforced by the powerful.
- Their influence over state behavior cannot meaningfully be understood in the absence of powerful states.

Koremenos, Lipson and Snidal
- Explicitly focused on the international level (differs from North)
- Arrangements can be created by "international actors," not just states.
- These arrangements can be seen as holding power OVER those actors (compel or forbid action).
- AND meaningful authority can be delegated to an agent (e.g. authorize!) who then acts on the same level as states

???

WHICH DEFINITION COMES CLOSEST TO CASSESE'S APPROACH GIVEN BY ART 38 OF THE ICJ CONVENTION AND BY THE EVIDENCE WE'VE EXPLORED IN OUR CASE STUDIES OVER THE LAST THREE WEEKS?

WHY?

- Mearsheimer's framing roots international law in how states view the world and focuses on shaping state's pursuit of their own interests.

- KLS frame the concept in a much broader way involving more constituencies and interests than just states with more goals than just power maximization.

- Rational design

- Transaction costs

- Risk aversion

Therefore, states design international institutions to facilitate and strengthen international cooperation.

???

Here are the key assumptions raised by Koremenos, Lipson and Snidal in their article presenting the rational design approach to international institutions (p781-2).

These assumptions represent the necessary links between the independent and dependent variables listed in Table 1 as conjectures.

WHAT QUESTIONS DO YOU HAVE ABOUT THESE ASSUMPTIONS?
- DO THEY ALL MAKE SENSE?


################################################
1. Rational design: States and other international actors, acting for self-interested reasons, design institutions purposefully to advance their joint interests.
2. Shadow of the future: The value of future gains is strong enough to support a cooperative arrangement.
3. Transaction costs: Establishing and participating in international institutions is costly.
4. Risk aversion: States are risk-averse and worry about possible adverse effects when creating or modifying international institutions.

Let's compare and contrast with Mearsheimer's offensive realist argument.

WHICH SET OF ASSUMPTIONS BETTER SETS US UP TO EXPLAIN STATE BEHAVIOR ON THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL? WHY?



WHERE DO THEY OVERLAP?
(Both accept)
- states are strategic
- cooperation is hard (due to anarchy and uncertainty)
- States are risk averse and fear their choices may come back to destroy them


WHERE ARE THEY DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT?
(The difference)
- Survival is not the only goal
- States value other benefits and those are possible to obtain through cooperation over a long enough time horizon (shadow of the future)



FOCUSING ON THE DIFFERENCES, WHICH ASSUMPTIONS COME CLOSEST TO OUR CASE STUDY EVIDENCE OVER THE LAST TWO WEEKS?

(Restrictive membership, scope, centralization, control, flexibility)


p763
Membership rules ( MEMBERSHIP )
- "Who belongs to the institution? Is membership exclusive and restrictive, like the G-7’s limitation to rich countries? Or is it inclusive by design, like the UN? Is it regional, like ASEAN, or is it universal? Is it restricted to states, or can NGOs join?" (770).

Scope of issues covered ( SCOPE )
- "What issues are covered?" (770).

Centralization of tasks ( CENTRALIZATION )
- "Are some important institutional tasks performed by a single focal entity or not? Scholars often misleadingly equate centralization with centralized enforcement. We use the term more broadly to cover a wide range of centralized activities. In particular we focus on centralization to disseminate information, to reduce bargaining and transaction costs, and to enhance enforcement" (771).

Rules for controlling the institution ( CONTROL )
- "How will collective decisions be made? Control is determined by a range of factors, including the rules for electing key officials and the way an institution is financed. We focus on voting arrangements as one important and observable aspect of control" (772).

Flexibility of arrangements ( FLEXIBILITY )
- "How will institutional rules and procedures accommodate new circumstances? Institutions may confront unanticipated circumstances or shocks, or face new demands from domestic coalitions or clusters of states wanting to change important rules or procedures. What kind of flexibility does an institution allow to meet such challenges?" (773).




ANY QUESTIONS ON THESE FIVE DESIGN MECHANISMS?

- WHAT THEY MEAN? HOW THEY WORK?



Ok, back to your cases!
