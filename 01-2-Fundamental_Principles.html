### Prep for Class
1. Split class into four groups as they come in

&lt;br&gt;

NEXT TIME:
- Lots of fun.
- Give the groups prompts
1. Agree on how you will define "fundamental", "borderline" and "wishful"
2. Evaluate each
- Made a google spreadsheet for collecting classifications
- Used that spreadsheet as guiding tool for Friday's assignment: For your assignment, bring a piece of evidence you believe will convince the class to change or reaffirm its classification of one of these principles.

&lt;br&gt;

Welcome back everybody.

This week we're starting off our exploration of international law by trying to establish a baseline we can work from.

- Within states, rules typically exist in a constitution or other formative document that offers the baseline on which a society functions.

- Our question today is, at the international level is there a similar set of foundational principles upon which international politics are organized.

I've assigned you a few readings from the excellent second edition of Antonio Cassese's book, International Law.

Judge Cassese was one of the most distinguished international legal minds of the post-war era.

Following the genocide in Yugoslavia in the 1990s the UN needed a court to investigate and prosecute these crimes.

The world turned to Judge Cassese to lead this new court.
- The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY)

He served a similar role when the international community decided to step in and investigate the assasination of the Lebanese PM, Rafic Hariri, in 2005.

Basically, when the world needed help with international law, Judge Cassese was the go-to guy.

### What did you think of the Cassese chapter?

&lt;br&gt;

His book gives us an international lawyer's perspective on international law.
- Very much rooted in the letter of the law and the importance of precedent and consistency.

Our perspective this semester will often begin with the "letter of the law" but our interest will be much more focused on actual actions taken at the international level.

&lt;br&gt;

The ideas advanced by Cassese in this chapter are truly a realist's nightmare.

### For those who remember their ir theory from way back, why would this chapter annoy Realists?

???

Our big motivating question today: Are there fundamental principles at the international level besides anarchy?

&lt;br&gt;

The idea that states are constrained by global "principles" of behavior is an assumption inconsistent with how they understand the world.

For realists, the international system is anarchic and only given its form by the actions of states.
- In other words, anarchy means the system itself is defined by its lack of overriding principles and meaningful enforcement.

The idea that any set of principles at the international level could “constitute overriding legal standards" and represent "the constitutional principles of the international community” (p48) would give Waltz and Mearhseimer hives.

&lt;br&gt;

However, as we all know, realism is just one approach for thinking about and explaining actions on the international level.

- It isn't truth, it is a set of assumptions that simplify a complex world.

Since we care about how the world actually works, and the international community has created a whole bunch of international law, we should explore it in order to decide for ourselves if any of it matters.

### Make sense?

### What are the two characteristics cassese asserts are true of each of these “fundamental principles”?
- (p48: 1. universal scope; 2. legally binding force)

### What is universal scope? 
- (Applies to all and in all places)

### What is legally binding force? 
- (All states committed to these principles.)

### And where do these “fundamental principles” come from?
- (“careful consideration of international practice”)
- (Treaties, GA resolutions, Declarations of states, Statements by government representatives in the UN, diplomatic practice and case law)

&lt;br&gt;

### Somebody sum this up for us, how is Cassese asking us to think about this list?

### - Is it any different from a Realist list that begins and ends with anarchy?
- (Remember, everything is an argument.)

&lt;br&gt;

This chapter represents an argument by Cassese that if you carefully review all of international law you will discover a set of ideas held in common by all states that describe a sort of global constitution.

This global "constitution" includes these seven principles and we should expect that any actions taken that violate these principles will be opposed by the global community.

You didn’t create it, you didn’t agree to it and your government runs the risk of punishment for defying it.

???

Our Big Q: Are we convinced that each one is "fundamental" to the international system?

&lt;br&gt;

To start, take a few minutes on your own and classify each principle as either: Fundamental, Borderline or Wishful thinking

- Remember, just because states violate a rule does not mean it isn't a rule!

- If you feel compelled to make excuses or apologize for an act, you are acknowledging the rule exists!

&lt;br&gt;

Compare your classifications to the rest of your group.
- Can you agree a single classification for each?

*ON BOARD*: One row per principle, one column per group
- Fill in the table with group rankings

#### Notes
1. Sovereignty of States (48-52)
    - jurisdiction: the power of central authority to exercise public functions over individuals located in a territory
    - jurisdiction to prescribe, jurisdiction to adjudicate and jurisdiction to enforce

2. Equality of States (52-3)
    - All sovereign states on equal footing.

3. Non-Intervention in the Internal or External Affairs of Other States (53-55)
    - A state may not interfere in the internal organization of a foreign state.
    - Not as sweeping a rule as it appears. 
    - State may not aid insurgents in a civil war (unless they qualify as a national liberation movement)

4. Prohibition of the Threat or Use of Force (55-57)
    - An "absolute all-inclusive prohibition"
    - Only military force proscribed (not economic sanctions)
    - Ony interstate threats banned (repress your own people as you wish)
    - Expanded in the 1970s to better protect weak states and groups
    - Don't forget, some general rules exist that explicitly allow the use of force.

5. Peaceful Settlement of Disputes (58-9)
    - States obligated to pursue peaceful resolutions and must be done in meaningful ways, not just keeping up appearances or faking it.

6. Respect for Human Rights (59-60)
    - Arguably this directly conflicts with sovereignty and non-interference principles.
    - Massive infringements make a state accountable to the whole community.
    - Must avoid seriously and repeatedly infringing on rights (not activated by sporadic or isolated violations)

7. Self-Determination of Peoples (60-64)
    - Firmly entrenched in three circumstances: 1. anti-colonialism, 2. ban on foreign military occupation, 3. all racial groups must have full access to government.
    - This acceptance of this principle has been selective and limited (to avoid encouraging chaos). Specifically, does not currently apply to ethnic groups, and national, religious, cultural or linguistic minorities.

### 1. Are we clear on the definition of each?
### - Any problematic concepts?

### 2. Which of these are we comfortable arguing are fundamental to the international system?
### - In other words, are you persuaded that any of these rise to the level of "constitutional principles of the international community"? Why or why not?

* Make sure to go through each:*
- Strongest case made by Cassese?
- Counter-argument from us?

### 3. Which of these do you believe **should** be a fundamental principle?
- Debate each


### 4. How do these principles compare to the criteria lists we made in class on Monday? Similarities and differences?
