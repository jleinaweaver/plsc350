.center[.size40[.content-box-blue[**Solve a Problem with an International Institution**]]]

.size35[
Write a report that identifies, analyzes and attempts to address a significant problem using an international institution.

1. What is the problem and why is it important?

2. Find an example of an international institution that has sought to address this problem in the past. What did it do and how effective was it?

3. Based on the tools we've explored (legalization, the rational design conjectures and PA theory) and the cases we've analyzed, what specific elements would you suggest for the design of a new international institution meant to address your chosen problem?

1. What is the problem you are targeting?

2. Why is it "important"? (Provide one piece of evidence)

3. Explain one prior attempt to address this problem with an international institution (Provide one piece of evidence)

*Split into groups of 4*

GROUPS, 20 mins, work as a sounding board for each member

- Take about 5 mins per person

- Hear them out and give them feedback on their proposal
    - Is their problem specific and detailed enough?
    
    - Are you convinced it is important? Why or why not?
    
    - What do you learn from the historical case?

<br>

Find new groups and do it again!

- 20 mins to hear the different projects and offer constructive feedback

<br>

INDIVIDUALS, reflect on the feedback and the different projects you heard about and take notes

- Outline the first two sections of your paper

<br>

.size35[
1. What is the problem you are targeting?

2. What important lessons did you learn from the historical case?

3. Make suggestions for the design of the new institution
    - Legalization: Level of obligation, precision and delegation?
    
    - Rational design: Which conjectures are most relevant/useful?
    
    - PA theory: What delegation benefits (and relevant control mechanisms) do you suggest?
]

???

Fleshed out:
- In terms of legalization, what do you suggest regarding the degree of hard or soft obligations, precision and delegation?

- In terms of rational design, which of the conjectures do you recommend we apply to the design of the new institution?

- In terms of PA theory, what delegation benefits might be most relevant and which control mechanisms would be needed to make them feasible?

<br>

My hope is that your answers to these questions are directly informed by our discussions today

- Also, for a coherent argument I expect that your big ideas in parts 1 and 2 here directly connect to your arguments in part 3!
