.size45[.content-box-blue[**How should we reform UN peacekeeping?**]]

???

Last class we examined UN Peacekeeping.

- We used a recent research article to help us think about why peacekeepers may commit misconduct (theory and evidence), and

- You brought in suggested reforms of how we might fix it.

&lt;br&gt;

### What useful elements can we take from the Horne, Robinson &amp; Lloyd (2020) article?

### - What explains PKO misconduct?

&lt;br&gt;

A double selection effect in play leading to terrible outcomes

1. Selection Problem 1: "Bad" states recruit and enlist "bad" militaries (e.g. those skilled in violence and/or corruption targeted at the people)

2. Selection Problem 2: "Bad" states incentivized to send their "worst" troops on peacekeeping missions!

&lt;br&gt;

### And what did we come up with in terms of reforms?

&lt;br&gt;

### Is everybody clear on the value of starting a reform conversation with a detailed analysis of a research article?

&lt;br&gt;

The model, validated by data, helps us identify specific causal mechanisms causing the problem.

- Rather than just spit-balling random reforms, we can tailor a reform policy to focus on the mechanisms we believe are most important.

&lt;br&gt;

THIS is the aim of high quality social science.

- Thinking theoretically and testing models with data gives you great power for understanding and changing the world.

???

Today we shift our focus to the UN Security Council.

- There are many, MANY critiques of the SC and that can make it hard to narrow down our work.

&lt;br&gt;

What I'd like to do is start by looking at some data and then use that to transition into the readings for today and the reform proposals you brought to class.

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;img src="libs/Images/12_2-Binder_Heupel2015.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

???

In 2015, Binder and Heupel took an interesting approach to trying to identify if the UN SC has a serious legitimacy problem.

&lt;br&gt;

In essence, Binder and Heupel argue that the UNSC's power depends on its perceived legitimacy

- While it has been granted considerable institutional authority, the follow-through of all its decisions basically depend on the compliance of the rest of the world

&lt;br&gt;

If over time, the UNSC:
- broadens its own authority, 
- denies states equal participation, 
- lacks transparency, 
- is dominated by the great powers, and 
- denies accountability, ...

&lt;br&gt;

THEN we shouldn't be surprised when other states become hostile to it, work to constrain it or simply begin to ignore it.

&lt;br&gt;

How would we possibly begin to measure "legitimacy"?

- **SLIDE**: The data

&lt;br&gt;

#### Notes
- The UNSC is likely "the most powerful international institution in the history of the nation-state system" but it's ability to wield power depends on its perceived legitimacy.

- The UNSC may lack legal legitimacy due to its frequent efforts to broaden its own reach and influence possibly beyond the consent of other states

- The UNSC may lack procedural legitimacy because it does not allow equal participation, lacks transparency and accountability and is dominated by great powers

- The UNSC may lack performance legitimacy due to its very mixed record of maintaining "international peace and security."

Therefore, the UNSC faces a legitimacy crisis in terms of its procedures and performance.

Two big research questions (239):
1. "First, how legitimate is the Security Council in the eyes of UN member states?" 
2. "Second, on what grounds are these ascriptions based?"

This is a tough one to diagram...
- "[Legitimacy] is considered to be the key to effective governance" especially for IOs (238-239).
- "Legitimacy is an elusive concept. It is used mainly to designate rule as rightful, moral, or justified" (240).
- "Considering evaluative statements as expressions of state perceptions implies that we do not conceive of legitimacy as a static quality of institutions but rather as the temporary result of an ongoing process by which legitimacy is cultivated, sustained, or forfeited" (240).

1. Legal legitimacy of an IO depends on state consent to its creation and the degree to which it follows its own rules.
    - Lockean view, legitimacy depends upon consent
    - Pursuant to conventional perspectives on international law, state consent is the principal source of legitimacy in the international realm (Henkin 1995:26, Rabkin 2005:266–267).

2. Procedural legitimacy: 4 sources
    - "First, the legitimacy of an IO is said to depend on the equal participation of all of its member states in formal decision making (Dingwerth 2007)."
    - "Second, the legitimacy of an IO is considered to be a function of transparency that enables interested states and stakeholders to trace the decisionmaking process (Caney 2006:748–749)."
    - "A third procedural standard is accountability, which means that states and other actors in whose name an IO takes decisions and who are affected by these decisions can hold the IO responsible (Grant and Keohane 2005)."
    - "Fourth, an IO’s legitimacy can be undermined if the organization is dominated by great powers and if weaker states are forced to bow to their interests and accede to their values (Coicaud and Heiskanen 2001:525–527)."
    - "Many scholars have pointed out that the Security Council does not meet these procedural standards" (241).
    - "Their criticism is that those states most affected by Council action are almost always excluded from the decision-making process, and that Council decision making is highly opaque and largely insulated from public scrutiny (Paul 2004:375). There is no judicial or quasi-judicial body entitled to determine whether the Council has overstepped its competences or violated international law, nor is the GA in a position to call the Council to account (Koskenniemi 1995). Finally, the dominance of the Security Council by a few powerful veto-holding states has been identified as the core challenge to the body’s legitimacy (Caron 1993:566)" (241).

3. Performance legitimacy
    - legitimacy depends on output.
    - "IOs are created with a specific aim; if they do not fulfill their purpose or if they create negative externalities, they will not be considered legitimate. Given that IOs frequently lack fair procedures, scholars have argued that good performance becomes the most important source of IO legitimacy (Scharpf 1999; Gutner and Thompson 2010). The most obvious way to assess IO performance is to examine whether the IO fulfills its mandate. Another way is to determine whether the IO applies its rules consistently, as consistency is believed to increase rule compliance (Franck 1990). Performance legitimacy of IOs can also depend on whether an IO manages to restrain great powers. International institutions can help build a legitimate order if they ensure that the hegemonic state does not exploit weaker states (Ikenberry 2001). Finally, the performance of an IO can be assessed by determining whether it avoids grave negative side-effects and, particularly, whether it respects fundamental human rights (Buchanan and Keohane 2006)" (241).
    - "As regards each of these criteria, Security Council observers consider its track record over the past 20 years to be ambivalent at best" (241-242).

**Outcome Variable**

- 1991, 1994, 1997, 2000, 2003, 2006, and 2009
]

???

Each year the UNSC submits an Annual Report to the GA

- "The annual reports summarize all of the activities of the Council and its subsidiary bodies including mediation, peace missions, sanctions regimes, international criminal tribunals, and cross-cutting issues." 

- "The reports also give an overview of all Council resolutions, meetings, communication brought to the attention of the Council, and the state of the reform debate on the Council’s working methods" (242).

&lt;br&gt;

After receiving the report the GA discusses it publicly

- Binder &amp; Heupel collected the records of these debates in the following years
    - "Following the logic of systematic sampling, we analyzed every third debate since the end of the Cold War."

- They then hand coded each evaluative statement made by a member state about the UNSC
    - Was the statement positive or negative?
    
&lt;br&gt;

**SLIDE**: Example

&lt;br&gt;

#### Notes
- 1,531 evaluative statements coded
- 1991, 1994, 1997, 2000, 2003, 2006, and 2009 (every 3 years since end of Cold War)
- Hand coding means reading each statement and then coding using their dictionary of indicators
- Each statement is coded by type of legitimacy and positive vs negative

Why are the statements meaningful?
- States provide (or remove) legitimacy to the UNSC through public statements
- "When making evaluative claims about the Security Council, states may ascribe legitimacy to it or they may reject its legitimacy on different grounds. We distinguish three such grounds as stressed by different legitimacy theories, namely legal legitimacy, procedural legitimacy, and performance legitimacy" (240).
- "In international politics, legitimation may occur through public statements, diplomatic exchanges, or practical support (Westra 2010:523); states may also apply strategies of delegitimation when they condemn a powerful state or revoke support from it in international institutions (Walt 2005). Some scholars focus on how subordinates legitimate power holders (Beetham 1991:19)" (240).

???

- Legal legitimacy refers to how clearly the UNSC operates within the confines of its institutional authority
    
- Procedural legitimacy refers to how well the UNSC allows for equal participation, transparency, accountability and is not being dominated by great powers
    
- Performance legitimacy refers to how well the UNSC is seen to be fulfilling its purposes.

&lt;br&gt;

### Strengths and weaknesses of this measurement approach?

### - Are we convinced this process will produce meaningful measures of UNSC legitimacy? Why or why not?

&lt;br&gt;

**SLIDE**: The findings...

&lt;br&gt;

#### Notes

**Legitimacy Indicators**
- Legal: 1) Article 39, 2) Chapter VII, 3) Instruments, 4) Competence
- Procedural: 1) Participation, 2) Transparency, 3) Accountability, 4) Great power dominance
- Performance: 1) Mandate, 2) Great power restraint, 3) Human rights

Binder and Heupel coded this statement as legal legitimacy (“Article 39”) and negative.

"The study of public rhetoric is challenging. It is difficult to ascertain whether statements made are in line with sincere beliefs or whether they are made strategically as part of a “stage performance” (242). But authors argue it is useful because:
1. "First, providing reasons and justification for positions in the public sphere is not only an important political act in itself (Kratochwil 1989; Hurd 1999:391), but it is also revealing with regard to the beliefs held by the intended audience" (242).
2. "Second, public rhetoric, even if used strategically, may nevertheless be consequential. Scholars have highlighted the “civilizing force of hypocrisy” (Elster 1995:251) and the process of “argumentative self-entrapment” (Risse 2000:23)" (242).

### Stipulating that pie charts are evil, what do we learn from this?

- Out of 1500+ evaluative statements made by member states about the UNSC across 7 years, 73% were negative!

- Whew. That's pretty rough!

Problem 1 - The veto is being used to protect bad states who are committing atrocities

&lt;br&gt;

### - Why was the veto power created? (p74-75)

&lt;br&gt;

### - Does the history of veto use look different in the Cold War vs the post-Cold War eras? (p75-77)

&lt;br&gt;

### - What characterizes the history of the use of vetos while atrocity crimes are ongoing? (p77-85)

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

### Based on your research for today, does anybody have a case that illustrates other reasons of concern about the veto power?

- A very cool collection of data maintained by the UN's Peace Security Data Hub [LINK](https://psdata.un.org/dataset/DPPA-SCVETOES)

&lt;br&gt;

    - Larger words represent more frequent topics

Figure 2 provides a graphical representation of the regression results

- The y-axis has been scaled such that aid in the year before a country’s election to the council is normalized to $100.

- The x-axis shows the time before election to the UN SC, the two years on the SC and the two years after rotating back off of it.

&lt;br&gt;

### What stands out to the authors in this Figure?

- "On average, a non-permanent member of the council enjoys a 59 percent increase in total aid from the United States and an 8 percent increase in total development aid from the United Nations" (p907).

- Authors find that this aid increase is "significantly larger during key diplomatic years"
    - When the public attention on the UN is high, the US pays much more (bribery!)

- "Second, aid payments sharply increase in the year in which a country is elected to the Security Council, remain high throughout the two-year term, and return to their earlier level almost immediately upon completion of the term."

- "Similarly, the rapid return to baseline aid levels after a country has completed its tenure suggests that the aid is not due to a newfound awareness of the country’s needs."

&lt;br&gt;

### Ok, make this clear for me, why is this a problem for the UN?

&lt;br&gt;

### Is it a problem for the US? Why or why not?

Figure 1 shows how UNSC membership affects economic growth, democracy, press freedoms, and security alignments with the United States.

1. UNSC membership undermines economic growth.
    - Over a four-year period, nations outside the Security Council grow by an average of 8.7 percent vs inside the SC grows by only 5.2 percent
    
    - That is a 40% decrease in growth

2. UNSC membership also undermines democracy

3. Restrictions on press freedom also increase during UNSC membership.

4. HOWEVER, "The final panel of figure 1, perhaps, suggests the true goal behind U.S. economic assistance to UNSC members. Relative to non-UNSC nations, UNSC nations increase their security alignment with the United States" (674).

&lt;br&gt;

Essentially the authors argue, in this and other work they've done (2013), that the bribes paid by the US go directly to the leader of the recipient country who is able to use it for his or her own purposes

- Allows them to reward followers and punish opponents

- Brutal, right?
