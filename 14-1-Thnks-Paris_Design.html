Welcome India to the biggest emitters club!

- US making improvements but emissions still massive!

&lt;br&gt;

So, this is where the world found itself post-Kyoto. 

- Some cuts happening amongst the OECD/Annex B countries (although not huge)

- Emissions remaining high in developed countries, and

- Emissions growing rapidly in the global south

Today we'll start with Dimitrov Radoslav's analysis of the negotiation leading to the Paris Agreement.

WHAT DO WE THINK OF DIMITROV AS A SOURCE OF THIS INFORMATION? PROS AND CONS?

*Force this discussion*

&lt;br&gt;

OVERALL, WHY DOES DIMITROV DESCRIBE THE PARIS AGREEMENT AS A BIG SUCCESS?



---

background-image: url('libs/Images/14_1-PA_Design_Old3.png')
background-size: 100%
background-class: center

???

- Quote from China's Closing Statement at top of paper: "The Paris Agreement is fair and just, comprehensive and balanced, highly ambitious, enduring and effective, and with legally binding force."

(1. policy obligations for all states)
(2. Attempt to offer the best of a bottom-up and a top-down treaty)



HOW DOES THE PA BLEND A BOTTOM-UP AND A TOP-DOWN APPROACH TO INSTITUTION BUILDING?

(countries set own goals BUT int'l community oversight and pushing you to ratchet up pledges every five years)

- "The new climate deal is a laissez-faire accord among nations that leaves the content of domestic policy to governments but creates international legal obligations to develop, implement, and regularly strengthen actions" (2).




WHO ARE DIMITROV'S "WINNERS" AND "LOSERS" FROM THE PA? IN TERMS OF COUNTRIES AND IDEAS?

- ANYBODY NEED CLARIFICATION ON THESE POINTS?

(SLIDE)

"Strengths of the agreement pertain to principled obligations to act, regularity and progression of national policy development, international transparency and accountability" (8).

PA generally favors developed countries of the North.
- Basically a pledge and review system (first proposed by Japan in the 1990s. (8)

Least fair to the African Group and other Least Developed Countries
- No reference to their special circumstances, weak on adaptation and "precludes any future claims for liability and compensation."

"Strengths of the agreement pertain to principled obligations to act, regularity and progression of national policy development, international transparency and accountability" (8).

Here are the key provisions of the treaty according to Dimitrov.

Compare and contrast this with the Kyoto Protocol for me.

WHAT ARE THE BIG STEPS FORWARD HERE?

ANY MISTAKES?

* Force this discussion *




Ok, Dimitrov identifies three big reasons the PA was a success.

First, the US and China kickstarted the process in 2014 with a bilateral deal.

Second, French leadership and secrecy were vital.

And third, negotiation dynamics and social learning from domestic policy attempts mattered.

I want to dig in on two of these.

Let's zoom in on this second factor: Laurent Fabius' role as COP 21 president.

DO YOU AGREE THE FRENCH DID THE RIGHT THING HERE? WHY OR WHY NOT?

- WHAT ARE THE PROS AND CONS OF ORGANIZING A GLOBAL NEGOTIATION AROUND SECRECY AND EXCLUSION OF BOTH STATES AND CIVIC SOCIETY?

* Force this discussion *


The Secret Ingredients (5)
- Heavy use of secrecy was crucial.
- The French presidency kept consultations secret so they could manage the many different blocs of interests. Private breakthroughs kept quiet to facilitate compromise.
- Weird anecdote on p6 about an invisible meeting between US and Saudi Arabia.
- Final texts only released at the last minute and presented as take-it-or-leave-it deals "to avoid provoking early opposition and to leave no time for reopening major issues" (6).
- "This raises important questions about transparency and legitimacy in global governance (Bernstein 2004)."

Now zoom in on the third causes according to Dimitrov: Persuasive Argumentation and Social Learning

Let's explore these arguments.

WHAT DO YOU THINK?



- ARE WE SURPRISED DIMITROV, AN EU NEGOTIATOR, WOULD ARGUE THE NEGOTIATION AND EU LEADERSHIP MATTERS?


- WHICH OF THESE COMES FIRST: THE NEGOTIATIONS MOVING PREFERENCES OR COUNTRIES ENACTING POLICIES THAT CHANGE THE INTERESTS?





Now I want us to continue to evaluate the design of the Paris Agreement while also familiarizing ourselves with your selected NDCs.

To start, let's talk through Article 4 of the Paris Agreement.

Article 4 contains the main guidance for states when designing their NDC submissions.

Everybody open up the treaty and let's review Article 4.

Help me construct a list of specific pieces of guidance states are supposed to keep in mind when designing their NDCs.

* ON BOARD (3 cols): All States, Developed, Developing *



We'll keep this focused on writing an NDC and the first 8 points in Article 4

* you guide them *

4.1
- All: Context is GHG emissions

4.2
- All: Specific domestic mitigation measures (policies)

4.3
- All: Highest possible ambition BUT CBDR + national circumstances

4.4
- Developed: economy-wide absolute emission reduction targets
- Developing: "enhance" efforts, "encouraged" to set targets

4.5
- Developing: Ambition can be contingent on financing

4.7
- All: adaptation co-benefits count as mitigation

4.8
- All: Provide all needed info for "clarity, transparency and understanding"

Search feature is SLOOOOOOOW

Also, be prepared for all kinds of weirdness (e.g. not a simple first submission vs second)

- Often what you'll see is first with a 2020-ish update to the first

- For our purposes we are interested in the updates as second submissions

&lt;br&gt;

If your chosen country only submitted NDCs in a different language, use Google Translate or pick a different country!
