### Prep for Class
1. Prep Canvas Forum for collecting NDC analyses


&lt;br&gt;

Last week we kicked off our work in the final section of the class by exploring the global effort to address climate change

- Specifically we focused on two international institutions: the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol

### In broad terms, what is the Kyoto Protocol approach to climate change?

### - What are its main obligations, how precise are they and how much delegation is in the treaty?

&lt;br&gt;

- Adopts the ultimate objective, key principles and institutional structure from UNFCCC
    - Including the Annex list! (e.g. who has to make cuts and who has to pay for cuts in developing world)
    
- Annex B emission cuts are good, BUT
    - The Australia clause sucks
    - All punishments for missing targets appear to be infinitely delayable or can be accounted for in future treaties
    
- Art 3 only applies to specific period of time for cuts (hopes that they would endure?)
    - So much of the big questions pushed off to future meetings (What is demonstrable progress? How do we calculate emissions?)
    
- CDM is a cool idea but how will financing work, who pays, how much, etc TBD

On Thursday we explored the data on emissions and treaty commitment to consider these three claims.

Here was our analysis of the Annex B states emissions behavior

&lt;br&gt;

### Why does this omit the US?
- (Never ratified!)

&lt;br&gt;

### And what does this suggest?
- (Much of the "developing world" cut their emissions relative to 1990)

???

One of the advantages of the approach in Baettig, Brander and Imboden 2008 is an attempt to evaluate the performance of all states against different targets.

- Remember, these scores measure each states emissions against whether or not they made improvements from the development trajectory they are on

- So, poor states can increase emissions as they grow their economies but did they emit less than might otherwise have been expected?

&lt;br&gt;

### Takeaways from this map of scores?

&lt;br&gt;

So, the Kyoto Protocol achieved some successes, but the bar may have been way too low

### Any questions on our material from last week?

For today I want to bring us up to date with the global climate negotiations by analyzing the Paris Agreement.

To do this I want to draw out three connections to our work last week

- How has the science, the emissions and the politics changed since the Kyoto Protocol?

Since the Paris Agreement is our currently operating global treaty I wanted to bring us up to date on the science of the problem

- At least, per the global consensus generated by the IPCC

&lt;br&gt;

### Remind me, who is the IPCC and why should we listen to them?

- From their "About" page: "The IPCC currently has 195 members. Thousands of people from all over the world contribute to the work of the IPCC. For the assessment reports, experts volunteer their time as IPCC authors to assess the thousands of scientific papers published each year to provide a comprehensive summary of what is known about the drivers of climate change, its impacts and future risks, and how adaptation and mitigation can reduce those risks. An open and transparent review by experts and governments around the world is an essential part of the IPCC process, to ensure an objective and complete assessment and to reflect a diverse range of views and expertise. Through its assessments, the IPCC identifies the strength of scientific agreement in different areas and indicates where further research is needed. The IPCC does not conduct its own research."

&lt;br&gt;

Obviously our scientific understanding has changed over the 28 years between these reports, but it is useful for us to consider how the political consensus reflects that evolution

- SMALL GROUPS: Compare and contrast the key conclusions of the Second Assessment Report with this, the Sixth

Welcome India to the biggest emitters club!

- US making improvements but emissions still massive!

&lt;br&gt;

So, this is where the world found itself post-Kyoto. 

### How are these changes likely to change the political dynamics of negotiating a new global climate treaty?

&lt;br&gt;

- Some cuts happening amongst the OECD/Annex B countries (although not huge)

- Emissions remaining high in developed countries, and

- Emissions growing rapidly in the global south

&lt;br&gt;

Quote from China's Closing Statement at top of paper: "The Paris Agreement is fair and just, comprehensive and balanced, highly ambitious, enduring and effective, and with legally binding force."

1. (Policy obligations for all states)

2. (Attempt to offer the best of a bottom-up and a top-down treaty)

&lt;br&gt;

### How does the PA blend a bottom-up and a top-down approach to institution building?

- (countries set own goals BUT int'l community oversight and pushing you to ratchet up pledges every five years)

- "The new climate deal is a laissez-faire accord among nations that leaves the content of domestic policy to governments but creates international legal obligations to develop, implement, and regularly strengthen actions" (2).

&lt;br&gt;

### Who are Dimitrov's "winners" and "losers" from the PA? In terms of countries and ideas?

### - Anybody need clarification on these points?

"Strengths of the agreement pertain to principled obligations to act, regularity and progression of national policy development, international transparency and accountability" (8). 

"The PA is weaker on the long-term global goal, adaptation policy, compensation for loss and damage, and technology transfer. Crucially, the PA lacks specificity on the international division of labor for reducing emissions" (8).
]

???

Dimitrov argues that the PA generally favors developed countries of the North.

- Basically a pledge and review system (first proposed by Japan in the 1990s. (8)

&lt;br&gt;

Least fair to the African Group and other Least Developed Countries

- No reference to their special circumstances, weak on adaptation and "precludes any future claims for liability and compensation."

&lt;br&gt;

SMALL GROUPS: Per Dimitrov, what are the big steps forward in the Paris Agreement?

- Developed countries take the lead, developing states should enhance their efforts in light of national circumstances (Art 4.4)
- Developed states shall provide financial resources (Art 9)
- Encourages market based mechanisms and carbon trading
- Compliance done by facilitative committee whose work is "non-adversarial and non-punitive" (Art 15)

Here are the key provisions of the treaty according to Dimitrov.

&lt;br&gt;

### What are the big steps forward here? Why?

&lt;br&gt;

### Anything on this list you think was a mistake? Things we shouldn't have given away?

- *Force this discussion*

&lt;br&gt;

Ok, Dimitrov identifies three big reasons the PA was a success.

1. The US and China kickstarted the process in 2014 with a bilateral deal.

2. French leadership and secrecy were vital.

3. Negotiation dynamics and social learning from domestic policy attempts mattered.

&lt;br&gt;

**SLIDE**: I want to dig in on two of these.

Let's zoom in on this second factor: Laurent Fabius' role as COP 21 president.

### Do you agree the French did the right thing here? Why or why not?

### - What are the pros and cons of organizing a global negotiation around secrecy and exclusion of both states and civic society?

- *Force this discussion*

&lt;br&gt;

#### NOTES
The Secret Ingredients (5)
- Heavy use of secrecy was crucial.
- The French presidency kept consultations secret so they could manage the many different blocs of interests. Private breakthroughs kept quiet to facilitate compromise.
- Weird anecdote on p6 about an invisible meeting between US and Saudi Arabia.
- Final texts only released at the last minute and presented as take-it-or-leave-it deals "to avoid provoking early opposition and to leave no time for reopening major issues" (6).
- "This raises important questions about transparency and legitimacy in global governance (Bernstein 2004)."

Persuasive Argumentation

Social Learning

Now zoom in on the third causes according to Dimitrov: Persuasive Argumentation and Social Learning

- Let's explore these arguments.

&lt;br&gt;

### Are you convinced by these? Why or why not?

&lt;br&gt;

### - Are we surprised Dimitrov, an EU negotiator, would argue the negotiation and EU leadership matters?

&lt;br&gt;

### - Which of these comes first: the negotiations moving preferences or countries enacting policies that change the interests?

#### Notes from prior classes

Article 4 contains the main guidance for states when designing their NDC submissions.
- 4.1: All States - Context is GHG emissions
- 4.2: All States - Specific domestic mitigation measures (policies)
- 4.3: All States - Highest possible ambition BUT CBDR + national circumstances
- 4.4: Developed only - economy-wide absolute emission reduction targets
- 4.4: Developing only - "enhance" efforts, "encouraged" to set targets
- 4.5: Developing only - Ambition can be contingent on financing
- 4.7: All - adaptation co-benefits count as mitigation
- 4.8: All - Provide all needed info for "clarity, transparency and understanding"
