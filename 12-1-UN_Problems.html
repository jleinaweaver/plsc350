The UN is kind of an umbrella term for a BUNCH of very different institutions!

### Where on the legalization table running from hard to soft law would we place each of these international institutions? Why?

&lt;br&gt;

### Bottom line, how much power has been delegated to the UN?

&lt;br&gt;

For the last few weeks we've been analyzing the design and effectiveness of the UN.

- This week I want to talk problems and possible reforms to address them.

Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla), Chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee that oversees foreign aid:

"What’s the role of the Human Rights Council? To pursue and to promote human rights, yet they have among the world’s worst human rights abusers [on the council]," the Florida Republican said. "It would be funny if for the fact it weren't so dangerous and again that we're spending so much money on that" ([Oswald 2023, Feb 1](https://rollcall.com/2023/02/01/house-foreign-aid-cardinal-sanguine-on-fiscal-2024-funding/)).
]

???

Comments made in Feb of this year as an example of common criticisms of the UN you hear on cable news or coming out of Congress.

- While these sound substantive (e.g. China is bad, spending is bad), they don't actually engage with the institutions in a useful way.

1. Countries that violate human rights can get onto the Human Rights Commission because that's how it was designed
    - Weirdly, that's a feature of the system and not a bug. The states are the principal and the UN is the agent! That's how delegation works in international law!

    - A UN that doesn't invite "bad" states to the table couldn't do the things we ask it to do.

    - OPINION: Criticizing the UN (global forum for problem-solving) for not being NATO (just our friends can play) is kind of stupid.

2. We have to pay for things we want in the world and the Human Rights Council budget is miniscule
    - Human Rights Council baseline budget was $133 million in 2022, US portion approx $29 million [OHCHR](https://www.ohchr.org/en/about-us/funding-and-budget)
    
    - In FY2023 the US House budgeted $810 million as an allowance for House members to run their offices ([FY2023 deets](https://demandprogress.org/legislative-branch-funding-breakdown-in-the-fy-2023-omnibus-bill/))
    
    - OPINION: $29 million is a number so small most Congresspeople ignore it if it were to pay for ANYTHING else. Heck, in FY2023 the US House budgeted $810 million as an allowance for House members to run their offices ([FY2023 deets](https://demandprogress.org/legislative-branch-funding-breakdown-in-the-fy-2023-omnibus-bill/)) which represents a $35 million increase from last year.

&lt;br&gt;
    
### NOTES
- The US provides approximately 22% of the UN budget ([CFR](https://www.cfr.org/article/funding-united-nations-what-impact-do-us-contributions-have-un-agencies-and-programs)) but that's because we have BY FAR the largest economy in the world and we designed the damn thing.
- In 2021 our $12.5 billion paid for peacekeeping, the International Atomic Energy Agency, the World Health Organization (WHO)and many, many other institutions that generate significant value for us.
- In a 4.1 trillion dollar US budget (FY2022) that amounts to .3%
- In FY2023 the US House budgeted $810 million as an allowance for House members to run their offices ([FY2023 deets](https://demandprogress.org/legislative-branch-funding-breakdown-in-the-fy-2023-omnibus-bill/)) which represents a $35 million increase from last year.

]

???

Whole theory section on p236

Premise 1: Domestic military behavior predicts international military behavior
- Militaries are likely to perform internationally in the same ways as they do domestically (good or bad).
- "...the abusive behavior of militaries and governments in their own countries should predict their behavior when deployed abroad as part of a PKO" (236).
    1. Violence: "For states that either (1) routinely use their militaries to terrorize their own populations or (2) are unable or unwilling to curb abuses by these forces operating domestically, similar behavior is expected when these forces are deployed in PKOs."
    2. Corruption: "Similarly, for states where official corruption is the norm, the uniformed agents of the state are expected to engage in corrupt acts when deployed."
- Opposite applies too: "This pattern should stand in contrast with states boasting self-restrained and accountable militaries routinely used in ways consistent with the public good and rule of law."

Premise 2: Militaries that harm their own people (violence or corruption) are more likely populated by individuals amenable to targeting the innocent
- "Bad" militaries are likely populated by dangerous individuals (those amenable to violence against citizens or corruption)
- Selection effect in "who is recruited for and who seeks entry into military service."
    - Demand-side: "...systems where military forces are engaged in regular misconduct—be it unlawful violence or nonviolent corruption—should seek to recruit individuals amenable to these behaviors."
    - Supply-side: "...individuals drawn to opportunities for unaccountable violence and/or graft should seek entry into states’ security services in places where a uniform offers these rewards."
    
Premise 3: Some states contribute their "best" troops to peacekeeping and others their "worst."
- Best: "...to gain operational experience, national prestige, or moral influence at the
UN or to equip troops at the UN’s expense (Bellamy and Williams 2010, 58–65)."
- Worst: Some states see sending peacekeepers as a chance for "simple profit, opportunities for extraction, or even temporarily removing bad actors from their own countries."
- The UN does a bad job tying reimbursement to peacekeeper behavior
    - "...the UN’s system of unaccountable reimbursements to TCCs (such that reimbursements may or may not go to the costs of equipping and fielding the state’s PKO contingent), as well as procedures for allotting mission subsistence allowances, which provide perverse incentives for both states and individuals to join a PKO (Pyman et al. 2013, 36)."
- "Arguments from selectorate theory suggest that militaries may capitalize on the resources and training gained through peacekeeping activities to increase their capacity for domestic repression—meaning even TCCs incentivized sending their best troops may have a propensity for misconduct in the field (Levine, Mackay, and Nasirzadeh 2016)."

Premise 4: There is huge demand for peacekeeping which means the "bad" almost certainly outnumber the "good"
- "However, the unexpected demand for post–Cold War peacekeeping, combined with the withdrawal of the western powers from most operations..."

Premise 5: UN mistakenly focuses its "misconduct prevention" on "peacekeeper training" which isn't at all the actual problem.
- "If our argument is correct, lack of education about what constitutes abuse is not the main source of misconduct among peacekeepers, and preemptive or remedial training may not be the answer to the problem of misconduct. Such misconduct ranges from low-level fraud to highly organized abuses of the most serious kind."
- "Sadly, most documented misconduct appears to be a conscious choice."

*Walk through the data collected and how it measured*

*Many of these notes come from separate Appendix (saved in Readings folder)*

- Category 1 SEA: "In this definition, sexual abuse is “[a]ctual or threatened physical intrusion of a sexual nature, whether by force or under unequal or coercive conditions. All sexual activity with a minor (a person under the age of 18) is considered as sexual abuse.” Sexual exploitation consists of “[a]ny actual or attempted abuse of position of vulnerability, differential power or trust, for sexual purposes, including, but not limited to, profiting monetarily, socially, or politically from the sexual exploitation of another. This includes acts such as transactional sex, solicitation of transactional sex, and exploitative relationships” (UN Missions—Key Terms n.d.) (237)."
- Category 1 Non-SEA: "...misconduct generally considered felonious in western systems of justice and oftentimes of behavior normally associated with organized crime" (237).
    - "cases involving risk of loss of life to staff or others; abuse of authority or staff; conflict of interest; gross mismanagement; bribery/corruption; illegal mineral trade; trafficking with prohibited goods; life threat/murder; abuse or torture of detainees; arms trade; physical assault; forgery, embezzlement; major theft/fraud; use, possession or distribution of illegal narcotics; waste of substantial resources; entitlement fraud; [and] procurement violations. (UN Missions – Other Misconduct n.d.)"
- Category 2: "...lesser abuses more characteristic of misdemeanor-level crime, ethical violations, or administrative incompetence" (237).
    - "discrimination; harassment; sexual harassment; abuse of authority; abusive behavior;3 basic misuse of equipment or staff; simple theft/fraud; infractions of regulations, rules or administrative issuances; traffic-related violations; conduct that could bring the UN to disrepute; breaking curfew; contract disputes; [and] basic
mismanagement. (UN Missions – Other Misconduct n.d.)" (237).

“The PTS seeks to measure political terror. We define political terror as violations of basic human rights to the physical integrity of the person by agents of the state within the territorial boundaries of the state in question.” 
- PTS scores come from three sources, each calculated on a 5-point ordinal scale, where 5 indicates the highest category of political violence against a population:
- PTS_A: Based on Amnesty International’s State of World’s Human Rights;
- PTS_H: Based on Human Rights Watch’s World Report;
- PTS_S: Based on the U.S. State Department’s Country Reports on Human Rights Practices.
- PTS_MISSION is coded as the average of PTS_A, PTS_H, and PTS_S.

Corruption:  CORR_MISSION_MIL:  
- Control of Corruption scores for the PKO, weighted by military contributor force size. 
- From the World Bank’s Worldwide Governance Indicators, this indicator measures “perceptions of the extent to which public power is used for private gain.”1 Control of Corruption scores range from -2.5 to 2.5, with a score of -2.5 indicating perceptions that state control of corruption is very poor, and a score of 2.5 indicating perceptions that state control over corruption is very good.

- The UNSC is likely "the most powerful international institution in the history of the nation-state system" but it's ability to wield power depends on its perceived legitimacy.

- The UNSC may lack legal legitimacy due to its frequent efforts to broaden its own reach and influence possibly beyond the consent of other states

- The UNSC may lack procedural legitimacy because it does not allow equal participation, lacks transparency and accountability and is dominated by great powers

- The UNSC may lack performance legitimacy due to its very mixed record of maintaining "international peace and security."

Therefore, the UNSC faces a legitimacy crisis in terms of its procedures and performance.
]

???

Two big research questions (239):
1. "First, how legitimate is the Security Council in the eyes of UN member states?" 
2. "Second, on what grounds are these ascriptions based?"

This is a tough one to diagram...
- "[Legitimacy] is considered to be the key to effective governance" especially for IOs (238-239).
- "Legitimacy is an elusive concept. It is used mainly to designate rule as rightful, moral, or justified" (240).
- "Considering evaluative statements as expressions of state perceptions implies that we do not conceive of legitimacy as a static quality of institutions but rather as the temporary result of an ongoing process by which legitimacy is cultivated, sustained, or forfeited" (240).

1. Legal legitimacy of an IO depends on state consent to its creation and the degree to which it follows its own rules.
    - Lockean view, legitimacy depends upon consent
    - Pursuant to conventional perspectives on international law, state consent is the principal source of legitimacy in the international realm (Henkin 1995:26, Rabkin 2005:266–267).

2. Procedural legitimacy: 4 sources
    - "First, the legitimacy of an IO is said to depend on the equal participation of all of its member states in formal decision making (Dingwerth 2007)."
    - "Second, the legitimacy of an IO is considered to be a function of transparency that enables interested states and stakeholders to trace the decisionmaking process (Caney 2006:748–749)."
    - "A third procedural standard is accountability, which means that states and other actors in whose name an IO takes decisions and who are affected by these decisions can hold the IO responsible (Grant and Keohane 2005)."
    - "Fourth, an IO’s legitimacy can be undermined if the organization is dominated by great powers and if weaker states are forced to bow to their interests and accede to their values (Coicaud and Heiskanen 2001:525–527)."
    - "Many scholars have pointed out that the Security Council does not meet these procedural standards" (241).
    - "Their criticism is that those states most affected by Council action are almost always excluded from the decision-making process, and that Council decision making is highly opaque and largely insulated from public scrutiny (Paul 2004:375). There is no judicial or quasi-judicial body entitled to determine whether the Council has overstepped its competences or violated international law, nor is the GA in a position to call the Council to account (Koskenniemi 1995). Finally, the dominance of the Security Council by a few powerful veto-holding states has been identified as the core challenge to the body’s legitimacy (Caron 1993:566)" (241).

3. Performance legitimacy
    - legitimacy depends on output.
    - "IOs are created with a specific aim; if they do not fulfill their purpose or if they create negative externalities, they will not be considered legitimate. Given that IOs frequently lack fair procedures, scholars have argued that good performance becomes the most important source of IO legitimacy (Scharpf 1999; Gutner and Thompson 2010). The most obvious way to assess IO performance is to examine whether the IO fulfills its mandate. Another way is to determine whether the IO applies its rules consistently, as consistency is believed to increase rule compliance (Franck 1990). Performance legitimacy of IOs can also depend on whether an IO manages to restrain great powers. International institutions can help build a legitimate order if they ensure that the hegemonic state does not exploit weaker states (Ikenberry 2001). Finally, the performance of an IO can be assessed by determining whether it avoids grave negative side-effects and, particularly, whether it respects fundamental human rights (Buchanan and Keohane 2006)" (241).
    - "As regards each of these criteria, Security Council observers consider its track record over the past 20 years to be ambivalent at best" (241-242).

*Walk through the data collected and how it measured*

- 1,531 evaluative statements coded
- 1991, 1994, 1997, 2000, 2003, 2006, and 2009 (every 3 years since end of Cold War)
- Hand coding means reading each statement and then coding using their dictionary of indicators

Why are the statements meaningful?
- States provide (or remove) legitimacy to the UNSC through public statements
- "When making evaluative claims about the Security Council, states may ascribe legitimacy to it or they may reject its legitimacy on different grounds. We distinguish three such grounds as stressed by different legitimacy theories, namely legal legitimacy, procedural legitimacy, and performance legitimacy" (240).
- "In international politics, legitimation may occur through public statements, diplomatic exchanges, or practical support (Westra 2010:523); states may also apply strategies of delegitimation when they condemn a powerful state or revoke support from it in international institutions (Walt 2005). Some scholars focus on how subordinates legitimate power holders (Beetham 1991:19)" (240).

Why annual reports?
- "The annual reports summarize all of the activities of the Council and its subsidiary bodies including mediation, peace missions, sanctions regimes, international criminal tribunals, and cross-cutting issues. The reports also give an overview of all Council resolutions, meetings, communication brought to the attention of the Council, and the state of the reform debate on the Council’s working methods" (242).
- "Following the logic of systematic sampling, we analyzed every third debate since the end of the Cold War."

### Strengths and weaknesses of these data choices?

"The study of public rhetoric is challenging. It is difficult to ascertain whether statements made are in line with sincere beliefs or whether they are made strategically as part of a “stage performance” (242). But authors argue it is useful because:
1. "First, providing reasons and justification for positions in the public sphere is not only an important political act in itself (Kratochwil 1989; Hurd 1999:391), but it is also revealing with regard to the beliefs held by the intended audience" (242).
2. "Second, public rhetoric, even if used strategically, may nevertheless be consequential. Scholars have highlighted the “civilizing force of hypocrisy” (Elster 1995:251) and the process of “argumentative self-entrapment” (Risse 2000:23)" (242).

"We analyzed the debates using the qualitative data analysis software Atlas.ti. The coding of the debates was carried out by both authors on the basis of a common coding scheme, which assured a high level of intercoder reliability" (242-243).

- "Our findings suggest that the Security Council suffers from a legitimacy deficit in the eyes of UN member states. Negative evaluations of the Council far outweigh
positive ones. This holds for all three grounds for legitimacy. Yet, the Council does not find itself in an intractable legitimacy crisis because it still enjoys some rudimentary degree of legitimacy. The legitimacy deficit results primarily from concerns regarding procedural shortcomings; misgivings regarding performance short-comings rank second. Whether or not the Council complies with its legal mandate has not attracted much attention" (239).

- The US cares about voting behavior in the UNSC so uses foreign aid to buy support for its positions (bribery!)

- There are political costs to the US government (and the recipient) of directing bilateral aid (bribes) to countries that are "politically distant"

- The World Bank and IMF provide a lot of aid money each year and the US holds a "privileged position" in determining where that aid goes

- Directing aid (bribe) money through a multilateral institution is more costly than aiding (bribing) directly so only worth it if the country is "politically distant"

Therefore, the US uses different kinds of foreign aid to buy the votes of non-permanent members of the UNSC. 
]

???

Premise 1: The US cares about voting behavior in the UNSC so uses foreign aid to buy support for its positions on the UNSC (bribery!)
- "The UNSC makes binding resolutions to investigate international disputes, impose sanctions and embargoes, and authorize the use of armed force" (1935).
- "In the absence of UNSC approval, domestic public support for foreign policies is more difﬁcult to achieve, and the US Congress is more recalcitrant (Voeten 2001). Importantly, UNSC resolutions are most valuable for the US government when they pass unanimously" (1935).
- TONS of literature showing the US buys votes both on the SC and in the GA!!!

Premise 2: There are political costs to the US government of directing bilateral aid to countries that are "politically distant"
- Two big dangers of bilateral aid to "politically distant" countries: 1) US voters tend not to support aid for purely strategic aims, 2) providing aid to "politically distant" countries "is inconsistent with standard aid policy" and tends to mobilize opposition to the government.
- Also, "If the government follows a questionable foreign policy, rival political elites (e.g., opposition parties, opposition movements, or competitors inside the ruling party) can offer cues to the domestic audience that mobilize opposition to the government (Aldrich et al. 2006; Berinsky 2007)" (1933).
- Similar logic at play for recipient country. Recipient leader may pay domestic costs (looks suspicious) for accepting aid from opposing country.

Premise 3: The World Bank and IMF provide a lot of aid money each year and the US holds a "privileged position" in determining where that aid goes
- "Like US bilateral ﬂows, IMF and World Bank money has been ﬂowing in large quantities to many countries since the end of World War II" (1934).
- "The boards typically operate according to a consensus rule, and management has agenda-setting power. Management, in turn, is subject to pressure from the US government, both because proposals are preemptively shaped to avoid US opposition and because representatives of the US government are actively involved in important IMF and World Bank discussions..." (1934).

Premise 4: Directing bribe money through a multilateral institution is more costly than bribing directly so only worth it if the country is "politically distant"
- "Multilateral organizations provide a convenient means of obfuscation" (1934).
    - "...it is harder to mobilize opposition against multilateral assistance because there is less clarity of attribution"
    - "George Ingram, a former senior staff member of the US House Committee on Foreign Affairs, recounts: “Typically, when the U.S. wants to support a country that is ruled by a corrupt, uncooperative, or autocratic government, U.S. assistance goes through private channels . . . or multilateral organizations” (Ingram 2019).
    - "The key beneﬁt of using multilateral agencies in this context is that their decision-making is difﬁcult to observe for the domestic audience. Partly because of nontransparent governance (Stasavage 2004) and a “culture of secrecy” (Grigorescu 2013) and partly due to voters’ “rational ignorance” (Vaubel 1986), voters know little about the functioning of multilateral organizations" (1934).
- Dangers of relying on the multilateral channel: 1) US shares power so "principal-agent costs are higher", 2) "overuse damages the organization's reputation for independence" which makes it worse for hiding your influence later.
    - These costs mean it is only worth it when the target of aid is politically distant

### Other Notes

- "Multilateral organizations can do the “dirty work” of their most powerful members (Vaubel 1986, 48) and help “launder” unpopular policies (Abbott and Snidal 1998, 18)" (1932).
- Bilateral foreign aid is used for "promoting development" and to advance the "foreign policy goals of donor governments. Donors give more aid to countries that are politically closer or geopolitically more important to them (Alesina and Dollar 2000)" (1933).
- "Powerful governments also use their influence over multilateral organizations like the IMF and the World Bank to favor countries they consider strategically important (Copelovitch 2010; Kilby 2013b; Stone 2011; Vreeland and Dreher 2014). Such countries receive more financing at better terms and other favorable treatments (Stone 2008)" (1933).
- "Multilateral lending increases efficiency, makes use of organizational expertise, and shares the financial burden at the cost of losing control over how exactly the money is spent... Bilateral aid, in contrast, gives donors more control and is perhaps better suited as a tool of strategic foreign policy" (1933).

THE DIRTY-WORK HYPOTHESIS
- "We expect governments to cooperate and exchange favors with other governments when the expected beneﬁts exceed expected costs" (1933).
    - Benefits: improved national security, economic gains, legitimacy, or political support resulting from cooperative behavior of the targeted government
    - Costs: price paid in terms of ﬁnancial transfers but also the potential mobilization of domestic opposition for granting such favors.
- "If the government follows a questionable foreign policy, rival political elites (e.g., opposition parties, opposition movements, or competitors inside the ruling party) can offer cues to the domestic audience that mobilize opposition to the government (Aldrich et al. 2006; Berinsky 2007)" (1933).
- "Both audience cost theory and experimental evidence suggest that domestic audiences punish their governments for inconsistency in foreign policy and for a lack of responsiveness to their preferred foreign policies" (same).
- Two big dangers of bilateral aid to "politically distant" countries: 1) US voters tend not to support aid for purely strategic aims, 2) providing aid to "politically distant" countries "is inconsistent with standard aid policy" and tends to mobilize opposition to the government.
- Why might execs want to give money to nonallies their citizens oppose? An attempt to incentivize the "political support from an otherwise unfriendly country" (1934).
- "Multilateral organizations provide a convenient means of obfuscation" (1934).
    - "...it is harder to mobilize opposition against multilateral assistance because there is less clarity of attribution"
    - "George Ingram, a former senior staff member of the US House Committee on Foreign Affairs, recounts: “Typically, when the U.S. wants to support a country that is ruled by a corrupt, uncooperative, or autocratic government, U.S. assistance goes through private channels . . . or multilateral organizations” (Ingram 2019).
    - "The key beneﬁt of using multilateral agencies in this context is that their decision-making is difﬁcult to observe for the domestic audience. Partly because of nontransparent governance (Stasavage 2004) and a “culture of secrecy” (Grigorescu 2013) and partly due to voters’ “rational ignorance” (Vaubel 1986), voters know little about the functioning of multilateral organizations" (1934).
- Dangers of relying on the multilateral channel: 1) US shares power so "principal-agent costs are higher", 2) "overuse damages the organization's reputation for independence" which makes it worse for hiding your influence later.
    - These costs mean it is only worth it when the target of aid is politically distant
- Similar logic at play for recipient country. Recipient leader may pay domestic costs (looks suspicious) for accepting aid from opposing country.

APPLIED to UNSC
- "Like US bilateral ﬂows, IMF and World Bank money has been ﬂowing in large quantities to many countries since the end of World War II" (1934).
- "The boards typically operate according to a consensus rule, and management has agenda-setting power. Management, in turn, is subject to pressure from the US government, both because proposals are preemptively shaped to avoid US opposition and because representatives of the US government are actively involved in important IMF and World Bank discussions..." (1934).

*Walk through the data collected and how it measured*

- p1936
- Article references Appendix A for details on data collection

Figure 1
- "Using the resolution-level data, we calculate a dyad-year count of how often countries vote against other members in the UNSC in a given year. Figure 1 shows the distribution of this variable for dyads involving the United States" (1937).
- "Examples of countries in the upper end of the distribution (with values of 8 or above) include Russia (in multiple years) but also nonpermanent members like Uganda and Poland (both in 1982) and Trinidad and Tobago (in 1986)."
- "Countries in the lower end of the distribution (with values of 1) include the permanent members France and the United Kingdom (in multiple years) and nonpermanent members like Morocco (in 1963), the Philippines (in 1980), Costa Rica (in 1997), and Gabon (in 2011)."
- "Many UNSC resolutions are unanimously adopted; the variable is positively skewed and often (∼50%) equals zero."

Aid Data
- Source: OECD
- "We measure US aid as logged disbursements of ODA in millions of constant 2015 USD" (1937).
- 1960-2015
- "A total of 150 countries received ODA from the United States, and the average country received US$4.6 billion over the entire period. We use disbursements rather than commitments because the US executive branch deviates from committed aid levels for political purposes (Carter and Stone 2015) and to follow the related literature (Vreeland and Dreher 2014)."
- "IMF loans are measured in logged millions of current SDR (special drawing rights, the IMF’s unit of account). During this period, 143 different countries participated in IMF programs" (1938).
- "When focusing on ﬁnancing provided by the World Bank, we start from the project-level data that the bank provides for more than 19,000 projects. For the analysis, we calculate the sum of World Bank loan commitments across all projects for recipient i in year t in logged millions of USD. In our data, 170 different countries received loans from the World Bank, and we record positive amounts for a total of 3,897 country-year observations. For observations with at least one active World Bank project, the mean aggregated loan size in our sample is US$240 million."
